<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860) was born in  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and was the second son of painter Charles Willson Peale. He was known primarily for his historical paintings and portraits, particularly those of George Washington. Peale painted his first Washington portrait in 1795 at the age of 17, in a sitting arranged by his father. From 1795-1800 he traveled in Maryland and the South painting portraits, and from 1801-1803 studied with Benjamin West in London.</p> 

<p>Peale returned to Europe from l808 to l8l0, and spent most of his time in Paris where he was inspired to take up historical painting. From 1813-1822 he lived in Baltimore where, in 1814, he established a museum for paintings and natural history that later became known as the Peale Museum. Peale's most famous allegorical painting, <emph render="italic">Court of Death</emph>, was completed in 1820 and was one of the most popular paintings of the decade.</p>

<p>In 1822 Peale moved to New York City where he embarked on an attempt to paint what he hoped would become the "Standard likeness" of Washington. In the process he reviewed portraits by other artists including John Trumbull, Gilbert Stuart and his father, as well as his own 1795 picture which had never truly satisfied him. His resulting <emph render="italic">Patriae Pater</emph>, completed in 1824, depicts Washington through an oval window, and is considered by many to be second only to Gilbert Stuart's iconic <emph render="italic">Athenaeum</emph> painting of the first president. Peale subsequently attempted to capitalise on the success of what quickly became known as his "Porthole" picture, collecting tesimonials praising the portrait from people who had known the president, and lobbying Congress, in vain, for a commission to paint an equestrian portrait of Washington. Despite his failure to gain such a commission, "Patriae Pater" was purchased by Congress in 1832 and still hangs in the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>Peale subsequently produced over 70 replicas of the "porthole" picture and in the late 1850s delivered a series of lecture entitled "Washington and his Portraits" along the East coast. He was also an accomplished writer and lecturer on natural history, and was among the founders of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, a president of the American Academy, and a founder of the National Academy.</p>

<physdesc></physdesc></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Letters from Rembrandt Peale discuss his <emph render="italic">Patriae Pater</emph> portrait and the equestrian portrait of Washington that he hoped would be commissioned by Congress following the acclaim that <emph render="italic">Patriae Pater</emph> received.</p>
<p>A typescript for Peale's address on "Washington and his Portraits" that was read before the New York Historical Society on June 16, 1857 is accompanied by a typescript of the address copied by George Tatham. Several handwritten pages and apparent additions or changes to the address are not included in the typescript.</p>
<p>Calling cards are for Harriet Peale and Miss L. C. Herring. Miss Herring's card is found with a 1932 receipt from Miss Louise C. Herring to Richard M. Fielding marked "sold" for a portrait of George Washington attributed to Rembrandt Peale, one "pencil scale" of Washington by Rembrandt Peale, and one self portrait by him. There is also a copy of a receipt for an 1863 money loan to Harriet Peale.</p>
<p>A manuscript, handwritten by Peale, with transcription, entitled "Portrait of Washington," repeats some of the sentiments Peale expressed in an 1825 letter to Elijah Hunt Mills, including his belief in the importance of supporting the fine arts, especially painting, which he believes "is capable of exciting the sentiments of Patriotism in a degree only secondary to Eloquence." Another handwritten manuscript appears to be an introduction to drawings "in this Book" by pupils in a Philadelphia high school.</p>
<p>Legal papers include two codicils to Harriet Peale's will which list the disposition of Rembrandt Peale paintings in her possession. Printed material includes a catalog of sale for Harriet Peale's estate listing the Rembrandt Peale paintings held by her at the time of her death. An additional catalog of sale is for the property of a household in Philadelphia whose owner is not identified.</p>
<p>Additional printed material includes a pamphlet about Peale's painting <emph render="italic">The Court of Death</emph>, as well as news clippings relating to Peale, his paintings, the Peale family and portraits of George Washington.</p>
<p>Artwork consists of ink drawings by Peale of Roman coins on a page affixed to two prints glued side by side on the verso of the drawings.</p>
<p>Photographs consist of photo cards containing two prints of the same negative from M. B. Brady's studio of a portrait of Rembrandt Peale and one photograph on a photo card of Harriet Peale.</p>
