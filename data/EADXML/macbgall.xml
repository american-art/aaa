<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Macbeth Gallery was established in 1892 by William Macbeth, a
Scotch-Irish immigrant who had spent ten years with the print dealer 
Frederick Keppel before he opened his doors to the art-buying public at 237 Fifth 
Avenue in New York. Despite the prevailing interest in foreign art at that time, particularly in 
that of the Barbizon and Dutch schools, Macbeth was determined to dedicate his 
gallery to "the permanent exhibition and sale of American pictures, both in 
oil and water colors."</p>
<p>Although some of the gallery's earliest exhibitions 
were of work by European artists, the business soon became the only 
gallery in continuous operation to keep American art permanently on display. 
In the January 1917 issue of <emph render="italic">Art Notes</emph>, Macbeth recounts those early days 
remembering that "The opening of my gallery......was a rash venture under
the existing conditions, and disaster was freely predicted."
Nevertheless, he struggled through the financial crisis of 1893 and persisted with 
his devotion to American art; slowly the market for his pictures grew 
more amenable.</p> 
<p>Macbeth moved to more spacious quarters at 450 Fifth Avenue in 1906 and two years later 
undertook what was to become the major event in the gallery's early history: the 1908 exhibition 
of "The Eight," featuring work by Arthur 
B. Davies, Willam J. Glackens, Robert Henri, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, 
Maurice Prendergast, Everett Shinn, and John Sloan. "The Eight" were an unlikely 
combination of social realists, visionaries and impressionists eager to challenge the dominating
influence of the National Academy. The exhibition received 
an immense amount of publicity and instantly entered into art history as a 
successful assault on tradition.</p>
<p>Despite the splash that the exhibition made 
and its implications for the future of American art, nothing that the 
gallery did subsequently indicated that Macbeth intended to capitalize on 
its significance. It is true that Macbeth supported many artists later considered 
leaders in American art when the public would pay no attention to them 
because of their modernist tendencies; Arthur B. Davies, Paul
Dougherty, Maurice Prendergast, Theodore Robinson, and F. Ballard Williams
all held their first exhibitions at his gallery. Nevertheless, neither Macbeth nor the gallery's 
two successive 
proprietors, Robert G. McIntyre (William's nephew) and Robert Macbeth 
(William's son), who joined the gallery in 1903 and 1906 respectively, ever 
developed a true interest in modern art. The November 1930 issue of
<emph render="italic">Art Notes</emph> summarizes their collective disdain for modernism, stating: 
"We believe that, by and large, modern art is amusing. We
are heretical enough to believe that much of it was started for the amusement
of its creators and that no one was more surprised than they when it was
taken seriously by a certain audience to whom the bizarre and the unintelligible
always makes an appeal." So while the Macbeths and McIntyre cetainly championed American artists
and insisted they deserved as much recognition as the Europeans, their deepest and most abiding interest was undoubtedly the established artists of the 18th and 19th-centuries and those of the early 20th-century who continued in a more conservative style. Artists such as Emil Carlsen, Charles Harold Davis, Frederick C. Frieseke, Robert Henri, Winslow Homer, Chauncey F. Ryder, Abbot Handerson Thayer, J. Francis Murphy, A. H. Wyant were the gallery's bread and butter.</p>
<p>When William Macbeth died in 1917 Robert Macbeth took up the reins with the assistance of Robert G. McIntyre . Although they incorporated the business as William Macbeth, Inc., 
in 1918 the gallery continued to be known, as it always would be, simply as Macbeth 
Gallery. Macbeth and McIntyre continued to show work in the same vein as the elder
Macbeth. They concentrated primarily on oil paintings at this time, having found by 
the 1920s that "oils are all that our gallery owners will buy," though they also exhibited an
occasional group of watercolors and pastels in addition to bronzes and other sculpture by contemporary American artists such as Chester Beach and Janet Scudder.
</p>
<p>Of the early American painters the Macbeths and McIntyre were particularly 
interested in colonial portraits and miniatures, especially those painted by 
prominent artists in the latter part of the eighteenth century such as John Singleton 
Copley, Gilbert Stuart, Thomas Sully and John Trumbull. In its early years 
the gallery also handled the work of a few prominent American etchers 
including Frank W. Benson, Emil Fuchs, Daniel Garber, Childe Hassam and 
Chauncey F. Ryder. The print department was generally discontinued, however, 
in the late 1930s although the gallery continued to show prints by 
contemporaries such as Stow Wengenroth.</p>
<p>In 1924 relative prosperity allowed the gallery to move uptown to 15 East Fifty-seventh Street. When the 1930s brought new 
financial hardship for the gallery Macbeth and McIntyre took a variety of 
approaches to boosting sales. In 1930 they decided to hold only group 
exhibitions throughout the season to the exclusion of one-man shows, and also 
held some special exhibitions of paintings priced at a hundred dollars each in the hope 
that they could tempt those "willing to take advantage of a rare chance to 
secure representative examples of good art at a most attractive price." A 
move to smaller quarters at 15 East Fifty-seventh Street in 1935 was made 
with the intention of concentrating their efforts on the work of fewer contemporary
artists, while continuing to handle 
the work of the older Americans they had long supported.</p>
<p>When Macbeth died suddenly and unexpectedly in August 1940 following 
an operation for appendicitis, McIntyre continued to run the gallery with the assistance of Hazel Lewis. During the 1940s McIntyre and Lewis showed primarily contemporary art in a wide range of media including oil, watercolor, pastel, drawing and sculpture, while continuing, as always, to show the occasional group of 19th-century Americans. The great success of the
gallery's later years was undeniably Andrew Wyeth whose first exhibition, 
held at Macbeth Gallery in 1937, resulted in the sale of all twenty-two 
paintings cataloged.</p>
<p>Although subsequent Wyeth exhibitions were also successful, McIntyre struggled financially throughout the 1940s and periodically considered liquidating the company. Although "vitally 
interested" in contemporary art by people such as Robert Brackman, Jay 
Connaway, Carl Gaertner, James Lechay, Herbert Meyer and Ogden M. Pleissner  
he found that, for the most part, it did not pay. McIntyre continued operations until 1953 when he decided that doing so for 
profit was not only a financial burden but also ran contrary to his desire 
to spend more time devoted to his first love, early American art. When the 
lease expired on 11 East Fifty-seventh Street in April 1953 McIntyre did not 
renew it. After closing the gallery's doors he sold art from his New York 
apartment and from his home in Dorset, Vermont. He officially dissolved 
William Macbeth, Inc., in 1957.</p> 
<p>The history of the Macbeth Gallery is a long and distinguished one with each successive proprietor making a significant contribution to art in America. William Macbeth helped establish an audience and a market for American art when few were willing to give it serious consideration. Robert Macbeth continued to cement the gallery's reputation as one of the leading firms in New York and was instrumental in organizing the American Art Dealers Association. Robert G. McIntyre claimed in a letter to Lloyd Goodrich, dated 22 June 1945, that the thing of which he was most proud was "the share I have had in the formation of the collection of the Addison Gallery of American Art, at Andover, Massacusetts." McIntyre was widely respected in the art community as a dealer, as an adviser to curators, and as a scholar whose research and book on Martin Johnson Heade helped "rediscover" an important American artist. One of his most significant and lasting contributions to the history of art in America, however, was undoubtedly his gift of the gallery's historical records to the Archives of American Art.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Macbeth Gallery records provide almost complete coverage of the gallery's operations from its inception in 1892 to its closing in 1953. The records document all aspects of the gallery's activities, charting William Macbeth's initial intention to lease his store "for the permanent exhibition and sale of American pictures" through over 
sixty years of success as a major New York firm devoted to American art. The collection measures 132.2 linear feet and dates from 1838 to 1968 with the bulk of the material dating from 1892 to 1953.</p>
<p>The gallery's correspondence files form the core of the collection and illuminate most aspects of American art history: the creation and sale of works of art, the development of reputations, the rise of museums and art societies, change and resistance to change in the art market, and the evolution of taste. Ninety-five feet of correspondence house substantial and informative letters from dozens of important American painters and sculptors, including older artists and younger contemporaries of the gallery in its later years. There are also letters from collectors, curators, other galleries, and critics.</p>
<p>The financial files found in the collection offer insight into the changing economic climate in which the gallery operated.  They include information ranging from the details of individual sales and the market for individual artists, to consignment activities and artist commissions, to overviews of annual sales. This information is augmented by the firm's inventory records and the photographs of artwork with their accompanying records of paintings sold. The inventory records provide details of all works of art handled by the gallery, both sold and unsold, and the buyers who purchased them; the photographs of artwork include images of artwork sold with accompanying sales information.</p>
<p>The highlight of the gallery's printed material is the publication <emph render="italic">Art Notes</emph>. Although published only until 1930, <emph render="italic">Art Notes</emph> provides an excellent and detailed view of the gallery's exhibition schedule and the relationship of the gallery owners with many of the artists whose work they handled. It was a house organ that also provided a running commentary on events in the art world. The gallery's fragile scrapbooks, maintained throughout the firm's history, provide further coverage of activities through exhibition catalogs and related news clippings. Printed material from other sources provides a frame of reference for activities in the art world from the mid-19th to the mid-20th-centuries and includes an almost complete run of the rare and important pre-Civil War art publication <emph render="italic">The Crayon</emph>.</p>
<p>Reference files record the interest which the gallery owners took in the work of early portrait painters and in later artists such as George Inness and Winslow Homer. Together with the immense volume of correspondence with buyers and sellers of paintings by the great portraitists and the Hudson River School found in the gallery's correspondence files, these records are still useful sources of information today and underscore the deep interest that the Macbeths and Robert McIntyre took in 18th and 19th-century American art.</p>
<p>The photographs of artists found here are a treasure trove of images of some of the major figures of the 19th and 20th-centuries. There are photographs of artists such as Chester Beach, Emil Carlsen, Charles Melville Dewey, Frederick Carl Frieseke, Childe Hassam, Winslow Homer, George Inness, Maurice Prendergast, and Julian Alden Weir, many of them original prints and the majority of them autographed.</p>
<p>With the exception of the "The Eight" and a few of their contemporaries, an important aspect of art history, the modernist movement, is generally represented in the Macbeth Gallery records only in a negative form as the three successive proprietors of the gallery showed very little interest in this area. Nevertheless, the collection is a highly significant source of information on many of the major and minor figures in American art in the period after 1890.</p>

<head>Arrangement </head>
<p>The Macbeth Gallery records were donated to AAA in several installments between 1955 and 1974 and were partially filmed in the order in which they were received. Consequently, those records that were filmed are often found on different sets of microfilm. Series 1.1: Correspondence, for instance, was originally filmed on four sets of microfilm. These files have since been physically merged but have not been re-filmed to reflect this arrangement. In an effort to provide continued access to the existing microfilm, microfilm reel information was gathered from four previous inventories of the film and provided, where possible, in parentheses after folder titles in the container listing. Researchers may need to consult several reels of film to review all material listed. Not all entries in Series 1.1: Correspondence have microfilm information with the folder title. This may be due to errors in the previous inventories or inconsistencies with the alphabetical arrangement used at that time.</p>

<p>The collection is arranged into eight series:</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>This series contains the gallery's general correspondence with artists, clients, curators, galleries, and art organizations and institutions. Outgoing letters are generally copies on 
highly-acidic fragile paper and are written by a combination of the 
gallery's proprietors and employees including William Macbeth, Robert 
Macbeth, Robert G. McIntyre, Hazel
Lewis, Henry Miller, and Marguerite Onderdonk. 
The correspondence is fairly complete although there is very little 
outgoing correspondence before 1913 and very little correspondence, both 
outgoing and incoming, between 1928 and 1931 and 1933 and 1936. Although the gallery closed in 1953 correspondence in this series extends to 1968 documenting Robert G. McIntyre's continued activity as an art dealer operating from his home. Some records, generally from 1915, 1916 and 1923, are damaged by mold. For preservation reasons these have been placed in a separate box at the end of the collection and appear in the container listing at the end of 1.1: Correspondence.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the substantial body of correspondence with artists. From the late 19th to the early 20th-century period there is significant correspondence with artists such as
Cecilia Beaux, Emil Carlsen, John F. Carlson, Charlotte Buell Coman, Arthur B. Davies, Charles Harold Davis, Charles W. Hawthorne, Charles Hazeltine, Robert Henri, Winslow Homer, Jonas Lie, J. Francis Murphy, Henry Rankin Poore, Chaucey F. Ryder, William Sartain and Abbot Handerson Thayer. From the early to mid-20th-century period correspondents include Jay Connaway, Carl Gaertner, Rockwell Kent, James Lechay, Herman Maril, Ivan G. Olinsky, Ogden M. Pleissner, Constance Richardson and Andrew Wyeth.</p>
<p>There are letters from Arthur B. Davies in which he writes of his travels 
in Europe during the 1890s, letters from Robert Henri from Ireland in the 1920s, 
and a letter from John Sloan to William Macbeth (one of only two in the 
collection) dated March 4, 1908, thanking Macbeth in the name of the "noble 
eight" for "all of the innumerable courtesies and kindnesses you have shown 
us in the long to be remembered exhibition of Feb. 3-18 1908." There are lengthy, detailed epistles from William Sartain written prior to, 
and during, the outbreak of World War I in Paris, and eighteen letters from 
Winslow Homer (although the two dated 1861 and 1876 respectively are copies) including an illustrated letter, an undated price list and notes on Homer paintings. There are also details regarding the 
settling of the Homer estate, which designated the Macbeth Gallery as sole 
selling agents of Homer's pictures in 1937, found in correspondence 
with members of the Homer family.</p>
<p>Although there is no correspondence with Homer D. Martin in the collection 
there are letters from his widow, Elizabeth, which reveal something of the 
painter's relationship with the gallery and chart the rise in popularity of 
Martin's work after his death. Elizabeth Martin's letters also discuss the 
appreciation of her husband written by her after his death and
published by William Macbeth.</p>
<p>Correspondence with Andrew Wyeth reveals Wyeth's original agreement with the Macbeth Gallery and
charts the launching of his career and apparently effortless rise to fame. Wyeth's correspondence includes illustrated letters 
and the original manuscript of the foreword to the catalog 
for his first exhibition at Macbeth Gallery, written by his father, N. C. Wyeth.</p> 
<p>This series also documents the gallery's hand in the development of some of the country's major public and private art collections including those established by the Addison Gallery of American Art, the Albright Art Gallery, Butler Art Institute, Carnegie Institute, the City Art Museum of St. Louis, Dallas Art Association, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and the Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
<p>Obviously, letters from the gallery's proprietors are found throughout the series, but there are also several named files for William Macbeth, Robert Macbeth and Robert G. McIntyre. William Macbeth's correspondence includes a copy of his opening announcement of 1892. A pencil sketch of two cows on the back of the announcement reminds us of his other love - the Macbeth Farm in Suffolk County, New York. Also found here are some letters of recommendation that William acquired prior to his emigrating to the United States from Ireland, and several letters regarding the sale of an Arthur B. Davies picture in which he refers to the need to let Davies know about the sale of the picture as quickly as possible. "You would understand why," writes Macbeth to James Quinlan on 1 February 1898, "if you knew this nervous impatient artist as well as I do."</p> 
<p>Robert Macbeth's correspondence deals primarily with gallery business up to 1920 but from that point on relates primarily to personal and family business. 
His correspondence includes one folder of twenty-seven letters from artists 
written in response to an invitation to a dinner honoring William Macbeth in 
1909. Most are addressed to Augustus Vincent Tack and include letters from 
Chester Beach, Charles H. Davis, Robert Henri, John La Farge, Jerome Myers, 
Chauncey F. Ryder and Carleton Wiggins. There is also a copy of a poem written by Albert Pinkham Ryder.</p>
<p>Correspondence with Jessie L. Macbeth and Phoebe K. Maccbeth deals with Robert 
Macbeth's estate and includes correspondence between Phoebe and Robert G. 
McIntyre discussing the gallery's finanical difficulties during the 1940s.</p>
<p>Robert G. McIntyre's correspondence generally relates directly to 
gallery business. Three of his letters (found in the files of correspondents to which the letters were addressed) are of particular note as they display his lucid and engaging style and reveal details of his friendships with some of the gallery's most important artists: a 1948 letter to 
Joseph J. Kwiat describes his memories of "The Eight" and recounts in 
particular his impressions of William J. Glackens, Robert Henri and George 
Luks; a 1956 letter to Bennard B. Perlman recalls "Tuesday 
evenings" at Robert Henri's studio; 
and a 1945 letter to Lloyd Goodrich of the Whitney Museum describes watching Childe Hassam paint and date a picture as if he were "writing a letter." "He was so emphatic that this 
was the proper procedure" writes McIntyre, "that one may take it for  
granted that a date on a Hassam is the date it was begun, not finished."</p>
<p>Records relating to McIntyre's research for, and writing of, his book on 
Martin Johnson Heade, published in 1948, can be found in his
correspondence with Maxim Karolik.</p>
<p>Although it is not always possible to determine which 
gallery member is responsible for an outgoing letter as they are generally 
unsigned copies, each of the proprietors appeared to enjoy letter writing 
and discussing their views on art with gallery clients. A good example of 
this can be found in letters to William Winter Drew in January and May of 
1925 which provide a lengthy and detailed discussion of whom the letter 
writer (probably Robert Macbeth) believes should be included in a 
representative collection of American art.</p>
<p>The dating and arrangement of undated incoming letters, particularly those 
written before 1913 which do not have an accompanying response from the 
gallery, is often based on pencil notations made by Robert G. McIntyre which, while 
assumed to be reliable, are not necessarily accurate.</p>
<p>While the series is primarily comprised of folders arranged alphabetically 
by name of correspondent, there are a few folders arranged by subject 
including several which relate to exhibitions at the gallery. These are 
interfiled alphabetically by folder title with the exhibition files, for example, being filed under 
"E."</p>
<p>Although the gallery's financial records are generally found in Series 2: 
Financial and Shipping records, Series 1: Correspondence does include 
substantial financial information in the form of correspondence with banks, 
insurance agents and accountants. Correspondence with Frederic B. Thomason, 
Inc., for example, consists of over two linear feet of records containing insurance information from 1895 to 1952.</p>
<p>Numbers appearing in parenthesis with the folder titles represent Archives of American Art microfilm reel and frame numbers compiled from previous inventories.  Not all entries have the microfilm information; this may be due to inconsistencies with earler arrangements or incomplete information in the inventories. </p>

<did><unitid>Series 2: </unitid><unittitle>Financial and Shipping Records, <unitdate>1892-1956</unitdate></unittitle>
<physdesc>(Box 96-110; 11.8 linear feet)</physdesc></did>
<scopecontent><p>This series provides a detailed record of the gallery's financial 
transactions through a variety of ledgers and account books. Although they 
lack systematic indexing and are somewhat awkward to use, these records 
provide an intriguing insight into art buying and collecting tendencies 
throughout the first half of the twentieth century. They also record the 
effect of fluctuations in the economy including, of course, the devastating 
Depression of the 1930s. Records in this series can be used more effectively 
in conjunction with the card files in Series 3: Inventory Records.</p>
<p>A large account book found here contains records dating from ca. 1918 to the 1930s with entries arranged alphabetically
by the name of the person, corporate body or function (such as "Accrued Salaries") to which each account applies. The book 
lists the dates and descriptions of transactions along with debits, credits and balances on accounts. Each alphabetical 
letter group is preceded by an index of accounts that fall in that section of the alphabet.</p>
<p>Information regarding commissions and commission credits due to artists, businesses or individuals is recorded in three 
sets of volumes: Artist Credit Books; Purchase Books and Commission Credits; and Artist Commissions, 
Commission
Credits and Purchases. Artist Commissions, Commission Credits and Purchases combine information that was previously 
contained in the other two 
types of ledgers. Details of purchases and commissions
are arranged chronologically. There are also two unidentified volumes filed here as Artist Registers which appear to record information related to framing dating from ca. 1924 to 1954. The registers are arranged chronologically and then list artists as well as titles and dimensions of artwork and dates received.</p>
<p>Bills and statements consist of copies of outgoing bills and statements from the gallery and are
arranged chronologically by year and alphabetically within those years</p>
<p>Cash Books provide a chronological list of cash transactions and Charge Books, also known as "Order Books" and "Sales 
Books," contain lists of charges for merchandise and order registers and are arranged chronologically.  Miscellaneous 
incoming bills are arranged chronologically by year and alphabetically by client within each year. Many of the bills were 
previously folded together with brown paper labels which have been transferred to the folders preceding the 
records to which they apply.</p>
<p>One item of particular note is a small untitled notebook summarizing annual 
sales figures from 1892 to 1935. The notebook clearly shows the ongoing 
economic collapse of the 1930s with annual sales plummeting from $487,283.62 
in 1929 to $92,659.02 in 1933.</p>
<p>The series also contains records of conisgnments from 1933 to 1951 and shipping records from the 1930s to the 1950s.</p> 
<arrangement><p>In general, financial records are arranged chronologically and then
alphabetically by client.</p></arrangement>

<p>The information found here supports that found in Series 2: 
Financial and Shipping Records and consists of card files recording stock disposition and a series
of stock books. The card files are an invaluable tool for 
tracking the artwork that passed through Macbeth's hands. The first file, 
arranged alphabetically by artist, records the disposition of all pictures 
sold and unsold and the second, arranged by buyer, provides similar 
information from a different angle. The cards record information such as
inventory numbers, names of artists, titles of pictures, dates received, media, sizes, framing information, 
owners, and sales prices. Some cards have photographs of pictures attached. </p> 
<p>While most of the stock books list gallery stock only, those for 1894-1903 and 1906 contain a record of pictures which 
were the property of William Macbeth, and for which he assumed liability in the event of loss or damage by, or resulting 
from fire.</p>

<p>This series contains printed material published by Macbeth Gallery in addition to exhibition catalogs from other galleries

<unittitle>Macbeth Gallery Printed Material, <unitdate>1862-1963, n.d.</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>This subseries contains the Macbeth Gallery publications <emph render="italic">Art Notes</emph> and <emph
render="italic">Biographical Notes</emph> in addition to scattered exhibition announcements, catalogs and news clippings.
The bulk of the news clippings in the collection and the gallery's exhibition catalogs can be found in Series 5:
Scrapbooks.</p> <p><emph render="italic">Art Notes</emph> was an occasional publication issued during the  art  season  "in 
the  Interest  of American Art and the Macbeth Gallery" from  1896  to  1930.  The  booklets  typically  contain  essays
on  artists,  current exhibitions at the gallery and current events in the art world and are an excellent  source  of
information  on  the  history of the gallery until 1930 and the opinions of the owners on various artistic trends and movements. Of particular note is an essay criticizing the  Modernist  movement which received attention in the press as well as letters, primarily of support, from many of the gallery's  clients.  Most  of the issues are in bound voumes although there are also some individual copies of the publication.  Numbers  14  and  24  are missing. Judging by the number of requests for Art Notes in the Series 1: Correspondence, it was an extremely popular publication, especially with those who artistic tastes tended toward the conservative.</p>
<p>Also found here is the publication <emph render="italic">Biographical Notes</emph>, 
a collection of short biographies of fifty artists "whose reputations and experience of over twenty years enables us to vouch with some degree of certainty." The publication was intended to satisfy "the natural curiosity of the picture collector to know who the man is who painted the picture, and what he has done in the past that may indicate his position in the future."</p> 
<p>Several of the exhibition announcements and catalogs found here are annotated and some are accompanied by news clippings. Catalogs include those for the gallery's fiftieth and sixtieth anniversaries. One catalog for an exhibition organized and circulated by the American
Federation of Arts in conjunction with the Archives of American Art is included here because it documented the role of
the Macbeth Gallery. The catalog contains an essay written by Robert G. McIntyre
for the exhibition entitled "The Macbeth Gallery: A Capsule History."</p>
<p>Also found here is a folder of six scattered news clippings recording milestones in the gallery's history such as the move to 15 East Fifty-seventh Street and the gallery's fiftieth and sixtieth anniversaries. At the end of the series is a box of duplicate copies of <emph render="italic">Art Notes</emph>.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>These folders contain non-Macbeth Gallery printed material including magazine and newspaper articles on a variety of 
artists as well as exhibition announcements and catalogs from other galleries, museums,
and organizations including the American Water Color Society and the National Academy of Design.</p>
<p>One item of particular note is a bound catalog of the exhibition <emph render="italic">Ten American Painters</emph> held at the Durand-Ruel, Inc., in 1898. The catalog is signed by each of the ten painters represented in the exhibition.</p>
<p>Also of note among the art publications is a set of bound volumes of the
pre-Civil War American art journal <emph render="italic">The Crayon</emph>. 
Published monthly in New York <emph render="italic">The Crayon</emph> was the first substantial periodical devoted entirely to the arts and is an 
indispensable resource for research on developments in the art world of the 
immediate pre-Civil War period. The volumes comprise an almost complete run 
of the journal which was published between 1855 and 1861. The Macbeth 
Gallery set dates from 1855 to 1859.
</p>
<p>At the end of the series are two delightful pamphlets concerning Frederick Keppel's relationship with James MacNeill Whistler. The first was "privately printed and copyrighted by Frederick Keppel" in 1904 and entitled <emph render="italic">The Gentle Art of Resenting Injuries</emph>, some "unpublished correspondence addressed to the author of "The Gentle Art of Making Enemies." The second is entitled "One Day With Whistler," published by Keppel in 1908. The first booklet describes an altercation between Keppel and Whistler in the form of reprinted correspondence between the two men and Keppel's commentary on the incident which he describes as a "brilliant specimen of characteristic abusive Whistlerism." There are two copies of the pamphlet, which Keppel published in "very limited edition" solely for a few of his friends, one addressed to "To Robert W. Macbeth from his friend-the author," and another to William Macbeth. The second pamphlet further describes "Whistler's intercourse with me and mine with him."</p>

<p>This series is the collection's main source of Macbeth Gallery exhibition catalogs and
related news clippings. Although incomplete, the scrapbooks provide a fairly comprehensive coverage of the gallery's history and include material on day-to-day events at the gallery as well as important occasions such as the gallery's fortieth, fiftieth and sixtieth anniversaries, news of the art world in general and some photographs. Three of the scrapbooks (1893-1898, 1902-1908, 1907-1914) contain printed material related to art, exhibitions and events elsewhere. Many of the exhibition catalogs found here are annotated with prices and other notes.  Notably missing is the catalog for the 1908 exhibition of "The Eight". </p>
<p>The scrapbooks are extremely fragile as the material found here is mounted on highly acidic paper and much of the material has come loose from the scrapbook pages. Consequently the microfilm of the scrapbooks has been digitized and is available for viewing on AAA's website.  The originals are closed to researchers. </p>

<p>This series consists of reference and research files relating to American artists and containing material gathered over time by the Macbeths and Robert G. McIntyre. Several references are made in the gallery's outgoing correspondence to the fact that the gallery was compiling a summmary of ownership of paintings by the best known American artists. Documentation related to this endeavor can be found here in a folder of collection lists of artwork in private and public collections.</p>
<p>Named artist files contain important information regarding the provenance of paintings, including some by 
Gilbert Stuart and Winslow Homer. The Gilbert Stuart file includes detailed histories of some of Stuart's work as well as 
legal documentation relating to their sale. The Homer files include photographs of five Winslow Homer paintings with  signed 
notations on the backs of the photographs by Charles L. Homer and Martha E. Homer testifying to the authenticity and 
provenance of the paintings. The Homer D. Martin file includes a copy of the book <emph render="italic">Homer Martin: 
A Reminiscence</emph> by Elizabeth Gilbert Martin, published by William Macbeth in 1904. There is also a print of the photograph used in the book, and a photograph of Homer Martin's gravestone.</p>
<p>Other material found here includes photographs of artwork, biographical information on the artists listed, scattered correspondence, clippings, notes, and copies of reference material from printed sources. Dates provided in the inventory of individual artist files apply only to original material, and do not include copies of 
documents found here from the early 1800s.</p>
<p>Files relating to various artists contain material similar to that found in the named artist files and also house a group of records, alphabetically arranged by artist, providing details of publications in which information about 
the artists listed can be found. Also found here is a 1916 compilation by William Macbeth of "Records of Portraits by Early American Artists" which contains notes on the provenance of various portraits. The last box in this series is housed in box 164 with other documents separated from the collection due to suspected mold problems. </p>

<unittitle>Photographs of Artists, <unitdate>ca. 1880-ca. 1968</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>This subseries contains a rich collection of photographs of many of the artists whose work was handled by the Macbeth
Gallery. As revealed in the gallery's correspondence files, artists occasionally wrote to the gallery enclosing pictures for what was known as Macbeth's "Rogue Gallery," presumably a file of photographs maintained for publicity purposes. A substantial number of the 
photographs are original silver gelatin and platinum prints; there are also several daguerrotypes and an original photo postcard. Many of the photographs are autographed and some are addressed to the gallery. Many of the photographs were taken by commerical studios such as Alman &amp; Co., De Vos, Haeseler, and Peter A. Juley, and 
several were taken by Gertrude Käsebier.</p> 
<p>The photographs are arranged alphabetically by artist with two group photographs at the end of the
subseries showing a group of artists in the Sherwood Studio Building in 1889 (Willard Allen, Carleton Chapman, Herbert Denham, 
Sam Isham, Willard Metcalf, Robert Reid, Robert Van Boskerck, Thomas Sullivant, and Harry Watrous); and the group of artists known as "The Ten" (Frank W. Benson, William Merritt Chase, Joseph R. DeCamp, T. W. Dewing, Childe Hassam, W. L. Metcalf,
Robert Reid, Edward Simmons, Edmund C. Tarbell and Julian Alden Weir) taken in 1908 on the occasion of their exhibition at Durand-Ruel, Inc. Folders may contain original prints in addition to copy prints and any accompanying or identifying information.  The photographs of artists have been digitally scanned and may be viewed on the AAA Digital Collections Database.</p></scopecontent>

<p>This subseries contains an exterior photograph, and a negative, of the gallery's first location at 237 Fifth Avenue; three photographs of the gallery's interior during an Albert Pinkham Ryder exhibition in January 1955 and a photograph thought to be of a group of people attending a Macbeth Galler "Smoker," ca. 1921. Also found is an interior photograph of the Lilienfeld Galleries in 1954 and an undated interior of an unidentified gallery.</p>

<unittitle>Photographs of Artwork and Records of Paintings Sold, <unitdate>ca. 1900-1952</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>At the beginning of this subseries is a disbound record book maintained by the gallery to record purchases of early 
American miniatures. The book contains photographs of each miniature, arranged alphabetically by artist, and includes 
notations on the portrait subject, and from whom and when it was purchased.</p>
<p>The subseries also contains a group of scrapbooks of photographs of works sold by the gallery, and stating the date 
of sale and buyer. Each scrapbook has an index, arranged alphabetically by artist, of the photographs included.  Books 1 to 4 and 16 to 18 are complete while books 5 to 15 have had the majority of the images removed. Scrapbook 9 is completely empty except for the index and Scrapbook 7 is missing.</p>
<p>The rest of the series is comprised of photographs of artwork, many of which were removed from the scrapbooks described 
above. These photographs are arranged alphabetically by artist.  The majority of the photos are undated; however, 
those that come from the scrapbooks in the collection are arranged at the back of the folders chronologically by date of 
sale in order to link them to the scrapbook indices.</p> 
<p>The artist most heavily represented in the photograph files is Winslow Homer. The gallery evidently maintained separate 
scrapbooks recording sales of Homer's work (labeled here for clarity as Scrapbooks One to Four) and these can be found here 
in addition to four folders containing photographs of 
Homer's work and related records. The first of these four folders contains miscellaneous photographs from scrapbooks. Those with 
dates of sale linking them to the scrapbooks in the collection are in chronological order in the back of the folder. The 
second folder contains photographs of works that are of questionable origin or are merely attributed to Homer. The third folder contains 
unidentified or unlabeled works by Homer. The fourth folder contains miscellaneous information on Homer exhibits and gallery 
collections of his work including photographs and lists of his work owned by galleries and museums.</p>
<p>The Homer Book One contains loose scrapbook pages with attached photographs of artwork which are arranged alphabetically 
by title; Homer Book Two is a scrapbook of photographs of  watercolors only, arranged alphabetically by title. The pages also 
include details about ownership and sales of the works.  Some of the photographs are missing.</p>
<p>Box 14 contains loose pages from a third scrapbook of photographs of oil paintings in the same alphabetical arrangement 
as Book Two. Book Four contains loose scrapbook pages with attached photographs of drawings by Homer, again arranged 
alphabetically by title.</p>

<head>Index: List of Exhibitions</head>
<p>Compiled primarily from the Macbeth Gallery records and AAA  collections loaned for microfilming, this chronological list of Macbeth Gallery exhibitions is extensive, but incomplete. While an attempt has been made to establish the accuracy of the information provided here, dates and titles of exhibitions are not guaranteed to be accurate. The list is annotated with AAA microfilm reel and frame numbers (e.g. Br15:192-193) for the exhibition catalogs available in the Macbeth Gallery records and scrapbooks and the American Art Exhibition Catalog collection and the Brooklyn Museum Records (loaned collections). Researchers should note that Macbeth Gallery exhibition catalogs are also held by the Frick Art Reference Library and the Watson Library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. </p>
