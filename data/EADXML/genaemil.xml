            <p>This collection was processed to a minimal level and a finding aid was prepared by Alexandra Krensky in 2013 with funding provided by the Smithsonian Institution Collections Care Pool Fund. The Archives of American Art has implemented minimal processing tactics when possible in order to increase information about and access to more of our collections. Minimal processing included arrangement to the series, subseries and folder levels according to the original order. Generally, items within folders were simply verified with folder titles, but not arranged further. The collection was rehoused in archival containers and folders, but not all staples and clips were removed.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Emily Genauer (1911-2002) was a modern art critic and columinst working in New York City from 1932 until well into the 1980s. In 1974, she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.</p>
            <p>Genauer was born in 1911 in Staten Island. She attended Hunter College and Columbia University, majoring in Journalism. She began her writing career in 1929 with the 
                <emph render="italic">New York World</emph>, which later became the 
                <emph render="italic">New York World-Telegram.</emph> She became a strong advocate for modern art and sculpture and introduced modern artists like Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera to the newspaper audience. She also followed lesser known artists and often visited their studios, and they, in return, regularly read her articles and reviews of their shows.</p>
            <p>Genauer left the 
                <emph render="italic">New York World-Telegram</emph> in 1949 after a dispute with the owner who accused her writing as overly sympathetic to "Communists and left-wingers" and told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She immediately went to work as the art critic for the 
                <emph render="italic">New York Herald Tribune</emph>, where she worked until 1967, when it folded. She then wrote a regular column for the 
                <emph render="italic">Newsday Syndicate</emph> until the mid-1970s. She also worked for 
                <emph render="italic">Harper's</emph> and in television and served on the council for the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1966 to 1970. Genauer was the author of a number of books, including 
                <emph render="italic">The Best of Art</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Chagall at the Met</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Rufino Tamayo</emph>.</p>
            <p>Genauer passed away in 2002 in New York City at the age of 91.</p>

                    <p>Research and reference files are arranged alphabetically by subject and labeled, where possible, with their original folder titles. Because the collection was minimally processed, contents of the folders were not checked against the original folder titles for accuracy, and all folders have the same date range.</p>
