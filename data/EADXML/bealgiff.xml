<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Painter and muralist Gifford Beal was born in New York City in 1879, the youngest of six children.  Beal began his art training at 13, when he accompanied his older brother, Reynolds Beal, to the Shinnecock School of Art for classes with William Merritt Chase.  Gifford Beal continued to study with Chase for ten years at Shinnecock, the Tenth Street Studio building in New York City, and the New York School of Art.  Beal attended college at Princeton University from 1896 to 1900, and from 1901 to 1903 he also took classes at the Art Students League with George Bridgman and Frank Vincent DuMond.  In 1908, Beal married Maud Ramsdell of Newburgh, New York, where the Beal family also had an estate.  They had two sons, William (b. 1914) and Gifford, Jr. (b. 1917).
</p><p>
Beal received all of his training in the United States at a time when European art training was the norm among his peers.  Beal's earliest subject matter was taken from the familiar worlds of New York City and the Hudson River Valley, where he frequently spent his summers.  Later work would depict other summer homes, including Provincetown, Rockport, and Gloucester, Massachusetts.  Throughout his career he explored a variety of styles in his approach to these and other representational subjects such as garden parties, the circus, Central Park scenes, and coastal scenes in the Northeast and the Caribbean.  
</p><p>
Beal exhibited at the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition almost continuously from 1901 to 1956, was a member of the Academy from 1914, and won at least seven awards given by the Academy over the course of his career.  He won his first award in 1903 from the Worcester Art Museum.  He exhibited regularly in major annual exhibitions and world expositions, including the Panama Pacific Exposition of 1915, where he won a gold medal.  
</p><p>
Gifford and Reynolds Beal exhibited in a two-man show in 1907 at Clausen Galleries, and the two brothers were both eventually represented by Kraushaar Galleries, where Gifford Beal had his first one-man show in 1920.  Beal served as president of the Art Students League from 1916 until 1930, the longest term of any president, and taught there in 1931 and 1932.
</p><p>
Beal was commissioned by the Section on Painting and Sculpture of the Works Progress Administration to paint ten murals for the Allentown, Pennsylvania post office in the late 1930s.  The Allentown murals depicted American revolutionaries hiding the liberty bell at Allentown.  In 1941, he completed two murals in the Department of the Interior building in Washington, DC: <emph render="italic">North Country</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Tropical Country</emph>, and he painted seven panels at Princeton University in 1943 depicting the life of the nineteenth-century engineer Joseph Henry.  He was awarded an honorary Masters degree by Princeton in 1947.
</p><p>
Retrospective exhibitions were held at the Century Club, San Francisco Museum, Des Moines Art Center, and Butler Institute in the early 1950s.  Upon his death in 1956, a memorial exhibition was held at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, where Beal became a member in 1943.

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of painter and muralist Gifford Beal measure 5 linear feet and date from 1889 to 2001.  The bulk of the collection consists of artwork; some correspondence, printed matter, pictorial subject files, photographs, and writings are also found.  Works of art are primarily sketches and sketchbooks in a wide variety of media.  Seventy-six sketchbooks are found.  Among the loose sketches are 28 oil paintings on wood board or panel, and fourteen large pastel drawings on canvas depicting dancing figures in a romantic style.  Artwork by other artists in the collection include prints by Arthur B. Davies, Rockwell Kent, and Denys Wortman.
</p><p>
Biographical materials include membership certificates, a marriage certificate, and a travel journal kept by Beal's wife Maud on their honeymoon.  Personal correspondence consists primarily of love letters with his wife.  Three folders of professional correspondence contain letters from Joseph Pennell (1925); Federal Art Project staff from the Treasury Department including Ed Rowan, Edward Bruce, and Forbes Watson (1938); Walker Hancock (1951); and a series of letters signed "Hyde," from Crow Island, Massachusetts, which may have been written by Edward Hyde Cox (1953-1954). </p>

<p>Also found among the papers are printed materials such as exhibition catalogs, clippings, and reproductions of artwork; subject files containing clippings, photographs, and other pictorial references to common subjects of Beal's artwork; and a few personal photographs and photographs of works of art.  Notes and writings are found among his sketchbooks, including one long autobiographical essay which may have been for a lecture, a few diary entries from 1942, and extensive notes on the color, form, and lighting of his sketching subjects.

<scopecontent> 
<p>Beal's Correspondence is divided into two groups: letters between Beal and his wife during their courtship and early marriage, and general correspondence.
</p><p>
Letters between Gifford and Maud Beal were written early in their relationship, and are primarily of a personal nature.  Beal's letters to his wife contain scattered references to his painting and his experiences in the art world during this period.  Two letters from 1906 are illustrated with small cartoons.  Scattered third party correspondence of a personal nature is also found among these letters.
</p><p>
General correspondence contains letters from Joseph Pennell (1925); Federal Art Project staff from the Treasury Department including Ed Rowan, Edward Bruce, and Forbes Watson (1938); Walker Hancock (1951); and a series of letters signed "Hyde," from Crow Island, Massachusetts, which may have been written by Edward Hyde Cox (1953-1954).  An undated letter from the artist William C. Palmer is filed at the end of the series.
</p><p>
Several postcards with handwritten notes are filed with picture files in the Print Materials and Subject Files.

<p>This series contains exhibition catalogs, magazines, newspaper clippings, pamphlets, postcards, and other printed materials related to the career of Gifford Beal.
</p><p>
Exhibition catalogs are for group and solo exhibitions by Beal, with a couple of exhibitions by others represented.  A 1938 catalog contains sketches, presumably by Beal, and a few of the other catalogs contain annotations.  Single sheets torn from catalogs of group shows are filed at the end of the exhibition catalog file.  
 </p><p>
Magazines with cover art by Beal include <emph render="italic">Town and Country</emph>, <emph render="italic">Christian Herald</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Spur</emph>.  Clippings contain articles about Beal's exhibitions and reproductions of his artwork.  Where found, entire issues of periodicals are filed separately.  Pamphlets on artists and art history are primarily small editions produced by Frederick Keppel and Co., which contain etchings of artwork.  Reproductions of other artists work such as Fourain, Daumier, Ingres, Degas, Dufy, and others include clippings, prints, and postcards, some of which are annotated with handwritten messages.  
</p><p>
Most of the material in this series has been digitized.  For longer published works, only the covers, title pages, and pages relevant to Gifford Beal have been digitized.  Additional printed materials are found in Biographical Materials and Subject Files.

<p>Photographs in this series depict Gifford and Maud Beal, Beal's artwork, and other subjects.  Photographs of Beal include a passport photo and an image of him painting, and there is a single wedding photograph of his wife, Maud Ramsdell Beal.  Other subjects include a snapshot of friends inscribed "Cosy, Arthur, and Little Dolly Sullivan" at the home of William Merritt Chase, a religious procession in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and a number of unidentified buildings and architectural subjects.
</p><p>
Photographs of works of art include paintings, murals, and sculptures.  The sculptures depicted in the photographs of artwork do not appear to have been made by Beal.  Only installation views and one photograph of a mural site have been digitized.  Otherwise, photographs of works of art have not been digitized.
</p><p>
Additional photographs are found in Subject Files.  See series description for further details.

<unittitle>Sketchbooks, <unitdate>circa 1900-1943 and undated</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>This series contains 76 sketchbooks with pencil, charcoal, pastel, ink, and wash sketches, drawings, and studies.
</p><p>
Subjects are similar to those found in Beal's paintings, with many life drawings, casual sitters (probably family members), circus scenes, marine subjects, genre scenes, cityscapes, landscapes, and buildings.  Two sketchbooks contain significant writings: one appears to be a lecture about art education, possibly written around 1925, and the other contains diary entries dated 1942.  Scattered annotations regarding color are found throughout the sketchbooks.  A sketchbook belonging to Gifford Beal, Jr., contains a couple of sketches by Gifford Beal, Sr. as well.
</p><p>
Where possible, sketchbooks are arranged chronologically, but the majority of dates were estimated during processing, and many remain undated.  Date estimates are based largely on women's attire in drawings and the assumption that they were drawn from life and not retrospectively.  Each group of sketchbooks is arranged by size, from small to large.

<unittitle>Loose Sketches, <unitdate>circa 1900-1951</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Loose sketches are found in a variety of media including pencil, ink, charcoal, pastel, and watercolor, and are generally unsigned and undated.  Subjects are similar to those found in sketchbooks, although loose sketches are found on a variety of supports including wood board, carbon paper, and canvas.  Most sketches on paper are arranged by broad subject categories, listed in the folder listing.  A 1928 sketch signed illegibly by an artist other than Beal is found with Figure sketches.  Most of the sketches have been digitized, however, items too large or too fragile to be handled have not been scanned.
</p><p>
Sketches on supports other than paper are filed separately.  Sketches on carbon paper seem to have been made as a preliminary process and re-used.  Large pastel and ink sketches on board range from studies to finished drawings, including several genre scenes that may have been preliminary drawings for Beal's murals.  Oil sketches on board range in size from approximately 3x5 to 11x17 inches and include landscapes, marine subjects, still lifes and figures.  Unlike other loose sketches, almost all of the oil sketches on wood board are signed or initialed, and one is dated 1914.  Pastel drawings on canvas may have been preliminary drawings, or cartoons, for murals.  All depict dancing figures in a romantic style, and one canvas is signed by Beal.
</p>
<p>Additional sketches are found in the Print Materials series, and scattered illustrated letters are found in Correspondence.</p>
