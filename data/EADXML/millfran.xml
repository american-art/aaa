<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>During his lifetime, Francis Davis Millet (1846-1912), always known as Frank, was a prominent artist who was well known for murals that contained exactingly accurate historical details. His broad-ranging career included work with worlds' fairs in Vienna, Chicago, Paris, and Tokyo as a juror, administrator, mural painter/decorator, or advisor. In addition, Frank Millet was a newspaper writer who published short stories and enjoyed adventures as a war correspondent during the Russo-Turkish War and in the Philippines during the Spanish American War.</p>

<p>Millet was among the founders of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and was influential in the early days of the American Federation of Arts.  Millet was involved with the American Academy in Rome from its inception and served as Secretary from 1904-1911.  In 1911, Millet went to Rome as Chief Administrator of the newly combined Schools of Fine Arts and Classical Studies. He died aboard the Titanic while traveling to New York City on Academy business.</p>

Found are biographical materials, diaries/journals, family letters, notes and writings, art work, printed matter, miscellaneous records, and photographs documenting Millet's wide-ranging artistic and writing career and personal life, including his death aboard the <emph render="italic">Titanic</emph>.  Also of interest are approximately twenty ink caricatures attributed to John Singer Sargent.</p>

Diaries/journals for the period 1858-1911 (16 vols., plus excerpts and transcripts) record Civil War experiences, the Russo-Turkish War, travels throughout Europe, to the northwest United States and Alaska, the  Orient, and Panama.</p>

<p>Letters from F. D. Millet to his family date from his years at Harvard, art training in Antwerp, residence in Italy, and service as a correspondent during the Russo-Turkish War.  Millet's letters include a few received from friends and associates, original letters sent by Millet to others, along with typescript copies of incoming letters. Also included is a file of letters addressed to Millet and others concerning the purchase and restoration of the Grange, his Broadway studio. There are four letters from Millet to his girlfriend Velma Marie Morse and scattered letters to Velma's father, A.P. Morse, and Fred Chapman.  Photocopies of letters from sister Kathleen Millet to her friend Margherita describe her brother's adventures during the Russo-Turkish War, and include an account of his wedding.  

His sister Lucia Millet's letters to her family were written while she was in England living as a member of her brother's household, and are rich with details of Frank's daily life, work, travels, friends, and the American colony in Broadway.  The letters of Lily Millet consist mainly of condolence messages sent upon the death of her husband, but also include letters from Samuel L. Clemens, Henry James, Ellen Terry [Carew], Charles Dudly Warner, her children, and others.</p>

Writings about him include texts by various relatives (all but one are unpublished).  The most extensive written piece is by niece Hilda Millet Booth and son John [Albert] Parsons Millet, and is accompanied by early drafts, notes, and related correspondence.</p>

<p>According to granddaughter Joyce A. Sharpey-Schafer, Lily Millet destroyed her husband's correspondence and was unwilling to cooperate with biographers.  However, many of F. D. Millet's letters to his family survive for the period 1867-1879.  The letters include a small number of original letters received by Millet from friends and associates augmented by typescript copies of incoming letters and a fairly large number of collected original letters sent by Millet, including two from John Singer Sargent.  The sources of this material are for the most part unknown, though a few of the typescript copies are identified as coming from collections at the Library of Congress.  The original outgoing letters may have been gathered by John A. P. Millet during the course of researching and writing his father's biography.</p>

<p>The letters discuss Millet's travels, education, journalistic and art career, art sales and commissions, and the activities of artist friends, family members, and acquaintances. One folder of letters, addressed to F. D. Millet and others, is about the purchase and restoration of the Grange, his Broadway studio.  There are four letters from Millet to his girlfriend Velma Marie Morse and scattered letters to Velma's father, A.P. Morse, and Fred Chapman. </p> 

<p>Typescript copies and a photocopy of four letters from sister Kathleen Millet to her friend Margherita, 1878-1879, are from an unknown source. Written from Paris, they mention Frank's "decoration for gallantry" during the Russo-Turkish War, and detailed information about his arrival home, describing his adventures, and an account of his wedding.</p>  

<p>Letters to Lily Millet are from Samuel L. Clemens, Henry James, Ellen Terry [Carew], Charles Dudley Warner, the Millet children, and other friends and acquaintances. The bulk of the letters are condolence messages to the family upon Millet's death aboard the <emph render="italic">Titanic</emph> in 1912.</p>

<p>The letters Lucia Millet wrote to her family are mostly from the period when she was in England, living as a member of her brother's Broadway household. She describes moving into Farnham House, Broadway, and their  later, permanent move to Russell House. Scattered throughout the letters are frequent mentions of Frank's activities, his work, travels, friends (including John Singer Sargent, Edwin Austin Abbey, and Henry James), and the American colony in Broadway. Of particular interest are references to Sargent sending lilies for the garden, and sewing white dresses for the girls to wear in Sargent's painting (<emph render="italic">Carnation</emph>, <emph render="italic">Lily</emph>, <emph render="italic">Lily, Rose</emph>). The letters also recount trips to London where she visited Sargent's and Whistler's studios.</p>  

<p>Attached to many of the letters are brief notes made by John A. P. Millet.</p>

<p>Millet's murals and paintings were noted for the historical accuracy of their  costumes and period details. Many of the notes from his extensive research are recorded in eleven undated copybooks, titled for easy reference.  Additional volumes of notes by Millet concern 17th century Italian art, Bulgarian history and costume (probably from his student days in Antwerp since it is in French), and the Philippines, compiled circa 1898-1899.</p>

<p>Writings by Millet consist of manuscripts of published and unpublished articles and short stories, and texts of lectures and speeches.  Writings about Millet are by relatives.  "Frank D. Millet: A Versatile American," by niece Hilda Millet Booth and son John A. P. Millet, is accompanied by notes, drafts, and related correspondence. "In Search of an Ancestor," by granddaughter Joyce A. Sharpey-Schafer, was published in 1984 as <emph render="italic">Frank D. Millet: Soldier of Fortune, 1846-1912</emph>.  A copy of the book is included with Series 6.</p>

<p>Art work by Millet includes twelve sketchbooks, containing pencil sketches, a few finished drawings, and a small number of ink drawings.  The sketchbooks were executed over a quarter of a century, from his student days in Antwerp through 1896, mostly during periods of travel.  Subjects, many of which are identified, include landscapes, buildings, and local peoples with emphasis on their clothing.  Loose sketches and drawings, 1872-1874 and undated, record Millet's travels are arranged by location. Two watercolors are "Menu, Nov. 14th, Peking" with a finished painting of a hillside pagoda by the water, on board; and a small sketch of a man and boy, on paper.</p>

<p>Work by other artists includes 20 caricatures drawn in ink, several of which are  annotated by John Singer Sargent.  Sargent experts Richard Ormond and Stanley Olson, in 1985 correspondence with the Archives of American Art attribute the caricatures to Sargent. Depicted are Sargent, Edwin Austin Abbey, Lily and Frank Millet, Mrs. Gosse, Mrs. Alma-Tadema [?], Mrs. Blashfield [?], and unidentified tennis players.</p>
