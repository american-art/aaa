<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>In 1914, at the age of eighteen, Peppino Gino Mangravite (1896-1978) settled in New York City with his father. The young man had already completed six years of study at the Scuole Techiniche Belle Arti in his native Italy, where coursework included the study of anatomy and Renaissance fresco techniques. Upon arrival in New York, he enrolled at Cooper Union, and by 1917 was studying under Robert Henri at the Art Students League.</p>

<p>Mangravite began his teaching career - one that lasted half a century - as assistant to Hans Peter Hansen at the Hansen School of Fine Arts in New York during the academic year 1918/19.  He was an involved and committed teacher who worked equally well with young children and college students.  For several summers in the 1920s, he ran summer art camps in the Adirondacks for children and adults. From 1926-1928 Mangravite lived in Washington D.C., where he taught at the Potomac School.  The majority of his life was spent in New York where he served on the faculties of Sarah Lawrence College, Cooper Union, the Art Students League, and, most notably, Columbia University. In addition, he spent 1937-38 as head of the art department of Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, and from 1940-1942 taught at the Art Institute of Chicago.  Mangravite was active in professional arts and education organizations. He wrote a number of articles about art education and served as chairman of the College Art Association's Committee for the Study of the Practice of Art Courses, 1943-1944.</p>

<p>In addition to teaching studio courses, Mangravite was a working artist.  Represented by Dudensing Gallery, and later Rehn Galleries, he exhibited widely throughout the United States, and, occasionally, abroad. He won a number of awards, including a gold medal for mural painting at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exhibition, 1926; the American Gold Medal Purchase Prize, Golden Gate Exposition, San Francisco, 1939; Alice McFadden Eyre Medal for best print, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1946; and a silver medal for mosaic design, Architectural League of New York, 1955.  Mangravite was awarded Guggenheim Fellowships in 1932 and 1935, and during that same period was commissioned by the U.S. Treasury Department to paint murals for post offices in Hempstead, N.Y. and Atlantic City, N.J.  Other commissions of note include a mural for the Governor's Mansion in the Virgin Islands, and a mosaic mural for the main altar of the Workers' Chapel, St. Anthony's Shrine, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>Sponsored by Columbia University and with the assistance of the United States Information Agency, Mangravite met with art department heads of several European universities in 1955 to discuss Columbia University's plans for a new arts center.  He also interviewed eight artists - Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Giorgio De Chirico, Marino Marini, Henry Moore, Giorgio Morandi, Georges Rouault, and Graham Southerland -recording their ideas about art, life, and education.</p> 

<p>Peppino Mangravite died in 1978.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Peppino Mangravite papers measure 6.1 linear feet and are dated 1918-1982.  They consist of correspondence, subject files, interviews with artists, writings and notes, miscellaneous records, printed matter, and photographs documenting Mangravite's career as a painter and educator.</p>

<p>Series 1: Correspondence includes chronological correspondence documenting Mangravite's career as a painter and educator. Correspondence is with employers, dealers, museums, galleries, collectors, clients, arts and educational organizations, publishers, and other artists.  Much of the correspondence is between Mangravite and his dealers, the Dudensing Gallery and the Rehn Galleries, and with other galleries and museums where his paintings were exhibited.  Mangravite's mural commissions are also discussed. Additional events documented include Mangravite's two Guggenheim Fellowships and his trip to Europe in 1955 to interview famous artists.</p>

<p>Mangravite's long teaching career is also documented in correspondence with Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence College, Avon School, Fieldston School of the Ethical Culture Schools, Potomac School, Dana Hall School, and the Colorado Springs Fine Art Center.  Other topics covered in the correspondence concern Mangravite's published or proposed writings, particularly articles and books reviews, most notably for the <emph render="italic">Saturday Review of Literature</emph> and <emph render="italic">American Magazine of Art</emph>.  Mangravite's membership activities in a variety of artists' organizations, such as the College Art Association, the American Society of Painters, Sculptors and Gravers; the American Artists' Congress, and the American Federation of Arts is well-represented in the correspondence.</p>   

<p>A list of major correspondents can be found in the series description for Series 1: Correspondence.</p>  

<p>Series 3: Interviews with Artists includes audio recordings, transcripts, photographs, notes and reports.  During the summer of 1955, Mangravite traveled to England, France, and Italy where he conducted interviews with eight artists - Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Giorgio De Chirico, Marino Marini, Henry Moore, Giorgio Morandi, Georges Rouault, and Graham Southerland - recording their ideas about art, life, and education.  In 1972, Mangravite recorded an interview with Rufino Tamayo in Mexico City, and the two artists were photographed together on that occasion.</p> 

<p>Series 4: Writings, Notes, and Lectures consists of articles, papers, talks, lectures, miscellaneous writings, and notes by Mangravite, and a small number of items by other writers.  Series 5: Miscellaneous Records includes art work by Mangravite and others, audio/visual records, biographical information, and financial records.  Among the printed matter in Series 6 are articles, exhibition announcements, invitations, catalogs, and miscellaneous printed items by and about Mangravite, art-related topics, and other subjects.  In Series 7: Photographs, photos of people include Mangravite, students, and other artists.  Photos of works of art are of murals and paintings by Mangravite and sculpture by Edgar Britton.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Chronological correspondence documents Mangravite's career as a painter and educator and is with employers, dealers, museums, galleries, collectors, clients, arts and educational organizations, publishers, and other artists. The majority of the letters are written in English, but some are composed in French and Italian as well. Although primarily business correspondence, there is also a significant amount of personal correspondence with friends, colleagues, and former students.  The letters often cover both business and personal topics, as Mangravite seemed to form close relationships with many of the people at the galleries and schools with which he was associated.  Correspondence dated from 1918 to the 1950s is comprised mostly of incoming letters.  Starting in the 1950s, the correspondence includes more outgoing correspondence, usually in the forms of onion skin copies and handwritten drafts. Correspondence is arranged chronologically, except two folders of undated letters, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of writer.  A list of major correspondents follows.</p>

<p>A large amount of correspondence is between Mangravite and his dealers, the Dudensing Gallery and the Rehn Galleries, and discusses financial agreements, sales, and accounts.  There is also correspondence with other galleries and museums where his paintings were exhibited.  Mangravite's mural commissions are also discussed in the correspondence. Also found are invitations to participate in exhibitions, notifications of prize awards and artwork sales, invitations to be on juries for art competitions, or miscellaneous requests from fellow artists, fans, collectors, and clients. Significant events documented here include Mangravite's two Guggenheim Fellowships and his trip to Europe in 1955 to interview famous artists.</p>

<p>Mangravite's long teaching career is also documented in this series.  Correspondence is found with Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence College, Avon School, Fieldston School of the Ethical Culture Schools, Potomac School, Dana Hall School, and the Colorado Springs Fine Art Center. Additionally, Mangravite was also a sought-after speaker and his correspondence includes many lecture invitations and requests as well as arrangements for accepted speaking engagements.</p> 

<p>Other topics covered in the correspondence concern Mangravite's published or proposed writings, particularly articles and books reviews, most notably for the <emph render="italic">Saturday Review of Literature</emph> and <emph render="italic">American Magazine of Art</emph>.  Also, there is some correspondence with publishers regarding book project ideas and manuscripts.  Mangravite's membership activities in a variety of artists' organizations, such as the College Art Association, the American Society of Painters, Sculptors and Gravers; the American Artists' Congress, and the American Federation of Arts are well-represented in the correspondence. Of particular interest is Mangravite's response to an artists' rental policy debate during the 1930s, concerning the payment of rental fees for artworks exhibited in shows and galleries.</p>

<p>Subject files, arranged alphabetically, represent committees, organizations, and conferences in which Mangravite participated as a committee member or speaker.  They contain printed matter, minutes, and notes.  The file for the American Art Research Council contains painting registration forms completed by Mangravite.  The file of printed matter concerning art courses in France and Italy probably was assembled for his daughter, Denise, who studied in Rome during the summer of 1955. Of particular interest is the file titled "Committee for the Study of the Practice of Art Courses, sponsored by College Art Association," which investigated how art was being taught and reported on its findings.  Because the members of the committee - George Biddle, Jean Charlot, Bartlett H. Hayes, J. Ward Lockwood, Peppino Mangravite (chairman), Daniel Catton Rich, Boardman Robinson, Edward W. Root, and Franklin C. Watkins - were unable to gather as a body, the work of the committee, including preparation and editing of its final report, was conducted by correspondence.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>During the summer of 1955, sponsored by Columbia University, and with the assistance of the United States Information Agency, Mangravite traveled to England, France, and Italy, where he met with artists and scholars, and art department heads of several European universities to discuss Columbia University's plans for a new Art Center. He interviewed Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Giorgio De Chirico, Marino Marini, Henry Moore, Giorgio Morandi, Georges Rouault, and Graham Sutherland.  Original audio recordings (7" reel to reel audio tapes) of all interviews except Giorgio Morandi are found here, along with excerpts of Mangravite's conversations with Braque, Chagall, De Chirico, Marini, and Morandi copied for radio broadcast (three 33-1/3 rpm lp recordings).  Transcripts of all interviews are included, though there is no English translation of Rouault's interview.  Each artist was also photographed with Mangravite on the day of his interview, except for Henry Moore who is represented by a single photograph taken circa 1955.  The photographs are filed in this series.</p>

<p>In 1972, Mangravite recorded an interview with Rufino Tamayo in Mexico City, and the two artists were photographed together on that occasion.  No transcript of the recording is among the Mangravite papers.</p>

<p>Photographs of other artists are filed with Series 7: Photographs, and a manuscript "Language of the Hand and Eye: Artists on Art, Life, and Education," by Mangravite, based on his interviews with European artists, can be found with Series 4: Writings, Notes, and Lectures.</p>
