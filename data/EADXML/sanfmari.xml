            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Marion Sanford was born in 1904 in Ontario, Canada and was raised in Warren, Pennsylvania. She studied painting at the Pratt Institute in New York, and worked for a period of time as a stage and costume designer. She developed an interest in sculpture, and studied the direct-carving method briefly at the Art Students League, but was largely self-taught. In 1937 she had her first exhibition of sculptures depicting women performing household chores and everyday tasks. She later created a series called "Women at Work" and her imagery of women would be the subject for which she would become best known, although she also completed bronze portraits and bas-reliefs. In 1941 and 1943 she worked as a Guggenheim Fellow, and became a member of the National Academy of Design, National Sculpture Society, and the National Association of Women Artists. Sanford won many awards and medals for her works and also created sculptures on commission, including a carved altar panel for the First Methodist Church in Warren, Pennsylvania. Marion Sanford died in 1987.</p>
            <p>Cornelia Van Auken Chapin was born in 1893 in Waterford, Connecticut. After exploring other interests, including aeronautics, she decided to become a sculptor in the 1920s. She studied with Gail Corbett and in the early 1930s began exhibiting her sculptures of animals. In 1934 she moved to Paris, France and studied with Mateo Hernandez as his only student. Under Hernandez, she learned the technique of direct-carving from life in stone and wood and won the 2nd grand prize at the Paris Exposition in 1937. In 1936, Chapin was the only foreign and woman sculptor elected to the Societaire Salon d'Automne in Paris. The threat of World War II brought her back to the United States in 1939. Chapin won many awards for her sculptures and became a member of the National Academy of Design in 1945 and the National Sculpture Society. She was also one of the founding members of Artists' for Victory, Inc. and a participant in the women's artist group known as "The Philadelphia Ten," a unique and progressive group of women painters and sculptors who often exhibited together in the Philadelphia area.</p>
            <p>In the late 1930s Chapin purchased a studio in New York City which had formally belonged to sculptor Gutzon Borglum. She shared the studio with her fellow sculptor Marion Sanford, and often modeled for Sanford's work. Sanford and Chapin remained close companions until Chapin's death in 1972.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The papers of sculptors Marion Sanford and Cornelia Chapin measure 2.8 linear feet and date from 1929-1988. Sanford and Chapin were close companions and shared a studio in New York City. The papers include scattered materials created by and about both women, including biographical materials, one folder of correspondence for each woman, a few writings and essays, newsclippings, exhibition catalogs, other printed materials, and four scrapbooks (three about Chapin and one about Sanford). Photographs are of Chapin only and of artwork of both women. There is also one sound recording of a radio interview with Chapin and several motion picture films of Chapin's home movies transferred onto video, mostly of her time working in Paris.</p>
            <p>Biographical material consists of scattered items documenting the careers of Marion Sanford and Cornelia Chapin. Included are a small amount of correspondence of both women, membership certificates, an index card file of Sanford's artwork, Chapin's written description of her sculpting process, and writings by others about Chapin. Audio and video recordings include a radio interview of Chapin after she sculpted a bear for the National Zoo and several of Chapin's home movies, most from her time working in Paris.</p>
            <p>Printed material includes exhibition announcements and catalogs for many group and solo shows of both women, news clippings about Chapin and Sanford, and a few reproductions of their artwork. Source files consist of postcards and clippings of various images that were most probably used as references or inspiration for their artwork.</p>
            <p>The collection includes four scrapbooks compiled by Sanford and Chapin documenting their careers through news clippings, a few exhibition materials, and photographs of their artwork. There are three scrapbooks about Chapin, and one about Sanford. Also found are two additional scrapbooks on the subject of bas-relief and sculpture. Photographs include several of Cornelia Chapin in her studio and with her teacher Mateo Hernandez. There are numerous photographs of artwork by Chapin and Sanford. Artwork includes drawings of animals, architectural elements, coins, and people, by either Sanford or Chapin.</p>

                    <p>Biographical material consists of scattered items documenting the careers of Marion Sanford and Cornelia Chapin. Material about Marion Sanford includes copyright documents for two sculptures, a certificate of membership in the Allied Artists of America, Inc., and a

There is one file of Sanford's correspondence that discusses the sale of her artwork, commissions, and awards received for her works, as well as the handling of Cornelia Chapin's estate.</p>
                    <p>Material about Cornelia Chapin includes certificates for her membership in the National Aeronautic Association of USA and the Allied Artists of America, Inc., a resume, and obituary. Also found is her written description of the sculpting process for her work "Sandstone Frog," as well as writings by others, including two articles by Dorothy Herzog, and an essay by Chapin's teacher, Mateo Hernandez, putting her work in the context of the history of sculpture. One file of Chapin's correspondence includes letters regarding her participation in Artists for Victory and the National Academy of Design, and discusses her commissioned bear cub sculpture for the National Zoo.</p>
                    <p>This series also consists of audio and film recordings of Cornelia Chapin. Included is a lacquer sound disc of an interview with Chapin by Mrs. Putnam for WCFM Radio, Washington, DC, on December 9, 1952. The interview, entitled "Introducing the New Bear Cub," discusses the dedication of Chapin's sculpture, 
                        <emph render="italic">Bear Cub</emph>, at the National Zoo in Washington, DC. There are nine film reels containing home movies of Cornelia Chapin. One movie entitled "Hilltop Happenings: Harpursville Summer 1932", shows Cornelia with unidentified friends or family doing daily chores as well as working on a sculpture of a female figure in her studio. Some of the movies were filmed in 1936 while she was working in Paris, and show several scenes of her and her teacher Mateo Hernandez at their studio demonstrating their direct carving method. There is also a large amount of footage of Chapin and Hernandez with friends at the zoo in Paris, and Chapin sketching horses at a racing event.</p>

                    <p>This series contains four scrapbooks compiled by Marion Sanford and Cornelia Chapin - one about Marion Sanford and three about Cornelia Chapin. The scrapbooks primarily contain newspaper and magazine clippings, exhibition announcements, other printed material and photographs of artwork. Two additional scrapbooks, probably compiled by Marion Sanford, are on the subjects of bas relief and sculpture. Similar to the source files, these scrapbooks contain clippings from magazines, newspapers, and other printed sources of sculptures by other artists, including numerous examples of ancient sculpture and relief.</p>
