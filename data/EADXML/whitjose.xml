<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Joseph White (1938- ) is a painter in Washington, DC. White works with a grid system and photographs to create his paintings.  In 1963 he received a B.A. from the San Francisco State University. He then moved to New York City where he exhibited abstract paintings at the 1964 and 1967 Whitney Biennials.  In 1976 he moved to Washington, D.C., and focused on representational painting.  He has frequently exhibited his works in Washington, DC, San Francisco, CA, and New York, NY, and is included in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, National Gallery of Art, Corcoran Gallery of Art, and San Francisco Museum of Art, among others.</p>
