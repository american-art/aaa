            <p>Cambridge artist and sculptor, Lilian Swann Saarinen (1912-1995), studied at the Art Students League with Alexander Archipenko in 1928, and later with Albert Stewart and Heninz Warneke from 1934-1936, before moving to Michigan where she studied with Carl Milles at the Cranbrook Academy of Art from 1936-1940. Saarinen was an accomplished skier and a member of the 1936 US Olympic ski team.</p>
            <p>At Cranbrook Lilian Swann met architect Eero Saarinen whom she married in 1939. She subsequently worked with Saarinen's design group on a variety of projects including the Westward Expansion Memorial, which later became known as the "Gateway Arch" in St. Louis. They had a son, Eric, and a daughter, Susie, before divorcing in 1953.</p>
            <p>Saarinen, who had developed an affinity for drawing animals in childhood, specialized in animal portraits in a variety of sculptural media. In 1939, she exhibited her sculpture 
                <emph render="italic">Night</emph>, which depicted Bagheera the panther from Rudyard Kipling's 
                <emph render="italic">Jungle Book</emph>, at the World's Fair. The sculpture was placed in the Boston Public Garden in 1986. In the 1930s and 1940s Saarinen was commissioned to work on a variety of architectural projects, including reliefs for post offices in Bloomfield, Indiana, Carlisle, Kentucky, and Evanston, Illinois, and the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois. She also executed commissions for the Harbor National Bank in Boston, KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines) at JFK Airport, the Northland shopping Center in Detroit Michigan, and Toffenetti's Restaurant in Chicago.</p>
            <p>Saarinen was a contributing author and illustrator for a variety of publications, including 
                <emph render="italic">Child Life</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Interiors</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly</emph>. In 1935 she illustrated 
                <emph render="italic">Picture Book Zoo</emph> for the Bronx Zoo and in 1946 Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, Inc. published 
                <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph>, a children's book which Saarinen wrote and illustrated.</p>
            <p>Saarinen taught ceramic sculpture to soldiers for the Red Cross Arts and Skills Unit rehabilitation program in 1945, served on the Visiting Committee to the Museum School at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 1959-1964 where she taught ceramics, and later taught a course entitled "The Language of Clay" at the Cambridge Art Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One of Saarinen's private students at Cambridge was her cousin, Edie Sedgwick.</p>
            <p>Saarinen died in Cohasset, Massachusetts in 1995 at the age of 83.</p>

                    <p>Sarrinen's correspondence files document her personal life and career. Personal correspondence includes letters written between Lilian and Eero Saarinen which provide insight into their relationship during the 1940s and early 1950s, and their decision to divorce in 1953. These letters also reference professional projects, including Eero Saarinen's involvement in the design of the Antioch College residence halls and his work on the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. The letters describe some of his planning meetings and enclose sketches of the UNESCO project.</p>
                    <p>Many letters from Susan Hammond, Saarinen's mother, chronicle events in the Swann and Sedgwick families. Hammond frequently enclosed letters sent to her about her daughter in her letters to Lilian. Family correspondence includes letters from Saarinen's son, Eric, her sister Lucy Livingston Schwartz, letters from members of the Swann family, and a letter from her cousin, Edie Sedgwick.</p>
                    <p>8 folders of corresondence document Saarinen's relationship with friend and frequent confidante, photographer Roxanne Lambie.</p>
                    <p>Letters which document Saarinen's professional life include correspondence with publishers and publications such as 
                        <emph render="italic">Child Life,</emph> for which Saarinen provided illustrations; 
                        <emph render="italic">Interiors</emph> regarding the publication of an article by Saarinen about her and her work; Otava Publishing Company including the 1956 contract for the Finnish edition of 
                        <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph>; Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, Inc., relating to the original publication of 
                        <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph> in 1946; and Rutgers University Press regarding Saarinen's proposed jacket design for the cover of 
                        <emph render="italic">A Short Chronology of American History 1492-1950</emph> (1952) by Irving S. and Nell M. Kull. Additional correspondence relating to Saarinen's writings can be found in Series 3: Writings and Notes.</p>
                    <p>Also found is correspondence with Caresse Crosby regarding the consignment of Saarinen's artwork to Gump's and other galleries in the 1940s, and referencing Crosby's 
                        <emph render="italic">Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly</emph> for which Saarinen provided illustrations. Correspondence with Alan D. Gruskin of Midtown Galleries, who Saarinen contracted to represent her nationally from 1943-1948, includes Saarinen's sketches for her 1944 exhibition at G Place Gallery in Washington D. C., under the direction of Caresse Crosby.</p>
                    <p>The series includes substantial correspondence with other artists and architects, many of whom were personal friends of Saarinen, including Merle Armitage, Walter Baermann, Alexander Calder, Charles and Ray Eames, Carl Koch, Henry Kreis, Carl Milles, Laszlo and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, Robert Venturi, and Harry Weese. Also found is correspondence with the design firm Knoll Associates, Cranbrook Academy of Art directors and artists Soltan Sepeshy, Maija Grotell and Marianne Strengell, 6 letters from Loja Saarinen, and a telegram from Eliel Saarinen.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of the correspondence relating to Saarinen's sculpture commissions can be found in Series 5: Project Files, but related correspondence is scattered throughout this series.</p>

                    <p>Saarinen was a prolific journal writer and her diaries are in bound volume and loose leaf form. Bound diary volumes from 1930/1931 to 1942 document her life from her "coming out year" and continue through the early years of her marriage to Eero Saarinen. Her 1939 diary opens in Florence, Italy, in August 1939, days before Germany's invasion of Poland, and describes the tenuous situation the newlyweds found themselves in and their difficulties finding passage back to the United States. The diary labeled 1936 and 1937 appears to span the years 1935-1938 and also contains a series of entries for 1958-1959.</p>
                    <p>Loose diary entries, beginning around circa 1934 and continuing to 1953, with scattered additional entries in the 1950s-1970s, focus primarily on Saarinen's marriage to Eero Saarinen. They document in depth her emotional struggles as a working mother attempting to forge her own artistic identity, maintain a healthy family environment for her children, and support Eero Saarinen's growing international success while not allowing that to stymie her own artistic ambitions. These folders include many handwritten notes and drafts of "letters" to Eero Saarinen which are journalistic in nature and include dream journals, "writings and ravings just before wedding," and notes found with her diaries.</p>
                    <p>Saarinen's engagement calendars are heavily annotated with notes documenting her professional appointments as well as her personal and leisure activities and those of her family.</p>

                    <p>Project files document Saarinen's work on a variety of commissions including those for book cover designs, federal government buildings, post offices, schools and playgrounds, in particular the Crow Island School reliefs, companies such as KLM (then Royal Dutch Airlines), businesses such as Toffenetti's restaurant in Chicago, and private clients including sister-in-law, Pipsan Saarinen. The majority of the projects documented here resulted in fully realized commissions for Saarinen, although several represent ideas and proposals.</p>
                    <p>Project files typically contain any and all of the following: correspondence and notes, many preliminary sketches, plans and blueprints, and photographs of artwork and project sites, with the bulk of the material being in the form of sketches. Sketches are primarily in pencil, although some are hand-colored with ink and/or paint.</p>
