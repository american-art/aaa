<acqinfo encodinganalog="541" id="a19">
<head>Provenance</head>
<p>Charles Sheeler's wife Musya initially loaned the papers to the Archives of American Art for microfilming in 1958, 1965, and 1966.  In June, 1966, she donated most of the earlier loaned materials. In 1964, Sheeler's friend Howard Lipman donated three photographs of Sheeler with Edward Steichen and John Marin. The third accrual was transferred to the Archives by the Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Portrait Gallery Library in June 1979.</p>

<separatedmaterial encodinganalog="544 0" id="a7">
<head>Separated Material</head>
<p>Portions of Sheeler's papers that were originally loaned for microfilming were not included in the later gifts and are available only on microfilm reel NSH-1. A watercolor study microfilmed on reel 1811 was later transferred to the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  These materials are not described in the container list of this finding aid. </p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Painter, photographer, lithographer and designer, Charles Rettew Sheeler Jr. was born on July 16, 1883 to Mary Cunningham Sheeler and Charles Rettew Sheeler in Philadelphia. He attended the School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia from 1900-1903 and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he studied under William Merritt Chase. He found early success as a painter and exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery in 1908.</p>
<p>Around 1910 Sheeler took up photography, and by 1912 financially supported himself photographing buildings for local Philadelphia architects. The following year, Sheeler exhibited six paintings at the 1913 Armory Show in New York. In the mid 1910s, Sheeler began to collect American antiques, and by the 1920s was actively acquiring Shaker crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>In 1916, Sheeler was hired by Marius de Zayas of the Modern Gallery in New York to photograph objects and artwork. From 1917-1924, he worked as the staff photographer for the Modern Gallery and moved to New York in 1918. In 1920, Sheeler was hired as a still photographer for <emph render="italic">The Arts Magazine.</emph></p>
<p>In 1926, Sheeler was hired by Edward Steichen to work as a fashion and celebrity photographer for Conde Nast Publications. His photographs were regularly featured in <emph render="italic">Vogue </emph>and <emph render="italic">Vanity Fair</emph>, but Sheeler also worked as a still life photographer for numerous advertising agencies. The following year, he was commissioned by the advertising firm N.W. Ayer and Son to photograph Ford Motor Company's new plant at River Rouge.</p>
<p>While working as a photographer, Sheeler continued to paint and used the subjects and composition of his photographs as a basis for his painting. His paintings <emph render="italic">Skyscrapers</emph>, 1922; <emph render="italic">Upper Deck</emph>, 1929; and <emph render="italic">American Landscape</emph>, 1930 are examples of Sheeler's technique of merging photographic imagery with painting and his overall precisionist style.</p>
<p>In 1931, upon the advice and guidance of Edith Halpert of the Downtown Gallery, Sheeler began to paint more often and to photograph less. Halpert became Sheeler's primarily dealer, and from 1931-1966 regularly exhibited his paintings and drawings. With Halpert's support, Sheeler produced <emph render="italic">Classic Landscape</emph>, 1931; <emph render="italic">American Interior</emph>, 1934; <emph render="italic">Silo</emph>, 1938; <emph render="italic">Amoskeag Canal</emph>, 1948; and <emph render="italic">Convolutions</emph>, 1952. In addition to Sheeler's partnership with Halpert, his work was exhibited by other galleries and museums throughout the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>In 1939, Sheeler married his second wife, Musya Metas Sokolova (1908-1981) and, in 1942, the couple moved to Irvington-on-Hudson, New York. Sheeler continued to paint and photograph until he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1959. After 1959, Sheeler remained active exhibiting his artwork until his death on May 7, 1965 in Dobbs Ferry, New York.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of painter, photographer, lithographer and industrial designer Charles Sheeler measure 4.9 linear feet and date from circa 1840s to 1966, with the bulk of the material dating from 1923-1965. The collection documents Sheeler's family, personal life and career through financial and medical records, awards, correspondence, writings, an autobiography, journal and notebooks, scrapbooks, exhibition catalogs and announcements, printed materials,  photographs, funeral records and artwork by Sheeler and others. The collection is particularly rich in Sheeler's writings, and also includes Sheeler's industrial designs and manufactured artwork.

<scopecontent> 
<p>Writings date from circa 1930s-1965 and include Sheeler's journal dated from circa 1950s-1963.  The journal includes poems, writings, transcribed correspondence, transcribed articles  (which were later published), and a paper delivered at a symposium on photography held at the Museum of Modern Art in October 1950. Two notebooks dating from about the same time includes miscellaneous notes and writings, adresses, and recipes.  Additional writings by Sheeler include an article that he wrote for <emph render="italic">Arts Magazine</emph>, writings on artists, and a manuscript version of his autobiography, along with notes and drafts.  The autobiography manuscript was commissioned by publisher Harcourt Brace in 1937, in which Sheeler outlines his career from his time at the School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia though the mid 1930s. The manuscript was not published, but was used as the basis for Constance Rourke's biography <emph render="italic">Charles Sheeler: Artist in the American Tradition</emph> published by Harcourt the following year.</p>

<p>The series also includes a short story by Musya Sheeler, and a short story illustrated with photographs of the Sheelers' by friend Dorothy Eidlitz.</p>

<scopecontent><p>The artwork series consists of art works by Sheeler and others, which date from circa 1930s-1960. The series is particularly rich documenting Sheeler's industrial designs, fabrics and manufactured objects. Artwork by Sheeler includes oversize sketches, industrial designs, fabrics and manufactured objects. The series also includes a drawing by Peggy Bacon  (a gift for Sheeler's birthday), and an art photograph by Minor White.  There is also a copy negative and copy print for this photograph.</p>

<p>The industrial designs are dated circa early 1930s, and were possibly commissioned by Samuel M. Kootz Associates. They include designs for a flower pot stand, cream and sugar set, sandwich tray, smoking stand, and a wood rack. The fabrics are in a variety of types and patterns including, knitted wool, linen, and printed rayon  (or silk). The objects include a glass tumbler manufactured by the Steuben Glass Company, and a salt and pepper shaker set and silver tea spoon, both possibly manufactured by Revere Copper and Brass Inc. The fabrics and manufactured objects were exhibited at the Downtown Gallery's <emph render="italic">Practical Manifestations in Art</emph>, in December 1934.</p>


<p>A copy negative and copy print have been created for Minor White's photograph, which are filed with the original.</p></scopecontent>
