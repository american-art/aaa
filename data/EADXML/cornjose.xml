<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Joseph Cornell, assemblagist, collagist, and filmmaker, was born on December 24, 1903 in Nyack, New York.  He was the oldest son of Joseph I. Cornell, a textile salesman and designer, and Helen Storms Cornell, and had two younger sisters, Elizabeth (b. 1905), nicknamed Nell and later Betty, and Helen (b. 1906), and a younger brother, Robert (b. 1910), who suffered from cerebral palsy.  Cornell shared close relationships with his siblings, and was especially attached to his brother whom he took care of as an adult.  His fondest childhood memories included family Christmas celebrations, outings to Manhattan where he saw vaudeville shows and strolled around Times Square, and trips to Coney Island where he encountered penny arcade machines.  These childhood memories, among others, inspired some of the themes later explored in his art work.</p>
<p>After his father's death in 1917, Cornell was sent to study at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.  He remained there for four years, but left without receiving a diploma.  During this time, the family moved from Nyack to Bayside, Queens, where they lived in a series of rented houses.  Cornell rejoined his family in 1921, at which time he went to work as a salesman in the Manhattan office of a textile wholesaler, the William Whitman Company.  He joined the Christian Science church in the mid-1920s, and in 1929, the family bought a house at 37-08 Utopia Parkway in Flushing, where he resided for the rest of his life, living there with his mother and brother after both his sisters married and moved away. </p>
<p>During the 1920s, Cornell developed his passion for walking the city streets and taking in their sights, sounds, and impressions; browsing in the secondhand bookshops along Fourth Avenue; and collecting material such as books, prints, postcards, and printed and three-dimensional ephemera.  He cultivated his growing interest in culture and the arts by attending opera and ballet performances, seeing plays (the 1922 play <emph render="italic">Rain</emph>, which starred Jeanne Eagels, was among his favorites), visiting galleries and museums, reading, and going to the movies.</p>
<p>In 1931, Cornell began to frequent the Julien Levy Gallery, where he encountered Surrealist art for perhaps the first time.  Around this time, he created his first works of art - a series of black-and-white collages composed from cutouts of nineteenth-century engravings - inspired by Max Ernst's collages, in particular his collage-novel, <emph render="italic">La Femme 100 tetes</emph> (1929).  Cornell went on to create three-dimensional works of art such as pill boxes and a glass bell series (consisting of objects arranged under a bell jar).  His work, including several collages and a glass bell, was first exhibited as part of the groundbreaking "Surrealisme" show at the Levy Gallery in January 1932.  He also designed the cover of the show announcement.  His first one-man show at the gallery, "The Objects of Joseph Cornell," followed in the fall of 1932.  (It was seven years before his next solo show.)  By this time, Cornell had been laid off from his job at Whitman's.  He was out of work for several years before getting a job as a textile designer at the Traphagen Commercial Textile Studio in 1934.  During the next several years, he continued to work on his art at night.</p>
<p>Around this time, Cornell began collecting movies and movie stills, and embarked upon various film-related projects.  In 1933, he wrote a scenario for a silent movie, <emph render="italic">Monsieur Phot</emph>.  A few years later, he made his first film, <emph render="italic">Rose Hobart</emph> (1936), comprised of re-edited footage from the B-movie, <emph render="italic">East of Borneo</emph> (1931), which starred the actress, Rose Hobart.  And he began work on a trilogy of collage-films - <emph render="italic">The Children's Party</emph>, <emph render="italic">Cotillion</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Midnight Party</emph> (circa 1937).  He then took a break from making films until the mid-1950s, but continued to collect film-related material, which he began to incorporate into his other art work.</p>
<p>In 1936, Cornell constructed his first glass-fronted shadow box, <emph render="italic">Untitled (Soap Bubble Set)</emph>, which was included that same year in the "Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, along with a cabinet box and several glass bells.  In creating some of his other early boxes, he began the practice of using photo reproductions of images which he located in books and magazines, or in the Picture Collection at the New York Public Library, among other places.  In his tribute boxes to actresses (1930s), he made use of publicity shots, and in the box, <emph render="italic">Dressing Room for Gilles</emph> (1939), he employed a photostat (or stat) of a reproduction of Jean-Antoine Watteau's painting, <emph render="italic">Gilles</emph> (1718).</p>
<p>Over the years, Cornell came into contact with various figures of the art, dance, and literary worlds.  In the 1930s and 1940s, he met the artists, Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and Salvador Dali, and befriended the artists, Lee Miller and Dorothea Tanning.  His formative friendships during 1940s were with the artist, Pavel Tchelitchew, the writers, Charles Henri Ford (founder of the avant-garde periodical, <emph render="italic">View</emph>), Parker Tyler, and Donald Windham, and the balletomane, Lincoln Kirstein (founder of <emph render="italic">Dance Index</emph>).  His other friends included the artists, Roberto Matta Echaurren and Robert Motherwell, the dancer and actress, Tilly Losch, and the poets, Mina Loy and Marianne Moore.  In the 1950s, he associated with artists from the Abstract Expressionist movement, including Willem de Kooning, Jack Tworkov, and Mark Rothko.  Beginning in the mid-1950s, he befriended many young artists, including Lee Bontecou and Carolee Schneeman, and young actresses, including Lois Smith, Gwen Van Dam, and Suzanne Miller, whom he sought to appear in his films.  And in the early 1960s, he met the Pop artists, Robert Indiana, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1940, Cornell developed a keen interest in dance, particularly ballet.  Ballerinas from the Romantic era, such as Marie Taglioni and Fanny Cerrito, especially captured his imagination, inspiring such works as the box, <emph render="italic">Taglioni's Jewel Casket</emph> (1940), and the <emph render="italic">Portrait of Ondine</emph> "exploration," which comprised a portfolio of material relating to Cerrito and her famous role in the ballet, <emph render="italic">Ondine</emph>. Cornell was also fascinated with the modern counterparts of the Romantic ballerinas.  In 1940, he befriended the Russian ballet dancer, Tamara Toumanova, and over the years produced many works in homage to her, including swan boxes (inspired by her role in <emph render="italic">Swan Lake</emph>), boxes made with scraps from her costumes, and scrapbooks of clippings, stats, and memorabilia.  In 1949, he became enamored of the French dancer, Renee "Zizi" Jeanmarie, after seeing her perform in <emph render="italic">Carmen</emph> and meeting her backstage, and he created several dance-related boxes in her honor.  In 1957, he met the ballerina, Allegra Kent.  After meeting again in 1964, they became friends, and she served as the subject of several works based on images reproduced from a Parmigianino painting.</p>
<p>In December 1940, Cornell left his job at the Traphagen textile studio to pursue art full-time.  He set up a workshop in the basement of the house on Utopia Parkway, which served as a combination studio and storage space.  While he spent most days at home, he continued to make regular trips into Manhattan to wander around the city, visit with friends, and hunt for material.  Around this time, he began to keep a diary, recording his day-to-day experiences (usually comprising his thoughts, feelings, impressions, ideas) on scraps of paper (including used envelopes, paper bags, napkins, and ticket stubs, among other fragments).  He would then type up some of these notes into more formal diary entries, but most of them remained, in his word, "scribblings."  Diary keeping eventually became one of his primary activities, along with box construction, collage, research, and collecting.</p>
<p>By this time, his art work was beginning to sell, yet he was not able to live from these sales alone.  During the 1940s, he primarily supported himself by doing freelance work for magazines such as <emph render="italic">Vogue</emph>, <emph render="italic">Harper's Bazaar</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping</emph>, supplying illustrations from his picture collection and designing covers and layouts.  He also regularly contributed pieces to <emph render="italic">View</emph> and <emph render="italic">Dance Index</emph>.  His notable contributions to <emph render="italic">View</emph> included "Enchanted Wanderer: Excerpt from a Journey Album for Hedy Lamarr" (December 1941), "Story Without a Name - for Max Ernst" (April 1942), and "The Crystal Cage [portrait of Berenice]" (January 1943).  His projects for <emph render="italic">Dance Index</emph> included various collage-covers, essays, and thematic issues, such as the Summer 1944 issue, which comprised a 22-page tribute to the Romantic ballerinas, Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Cerrito, and Fanny Elssler.  To supplement his income, Cornell also held brief positions at an electronics plant, the Allied Control Company, Inc. (in 1943), and at a nursery, the Garden Centre (in 1944).</p>
<p>In 1942, Cornell created one of his more memorable works, <emph render="italic">Medici Slot Machine</emph>, embarking upon a large series of Medici boxes in which he utilized reproductions of portraits by Italian Renaissance artists, such as Sofonisba Anguissola and Pinturicchio.  His other boxes from this time period explored themes ranging from ballet, as in <emph render="italic">A Pantry Ballet (for Jacques Offenbach)</emph> (1942), to doomed love, as in <emph render="italic">Paolo and Francesca</emph> (1943-48), to nature, as in the Sand Boxes (1940s) and Sand Fountains (1950s).  Cornell often created boxes in series, producing variations on a theme with variants that differed significantly or only slightly.  Over the years, series included: Pink Palaces, Pharmacies, Habitats, Aviaries, Dovecotes, Hotels, Observatories, and Night Skies, among others. </p>
<p>In late 1945, Cornell joined the Hugo Gallery, which was run by Alexander Iolas, and a year later mounted the show, "Romantic Museum at the Hugo Gallery: Portraits of Women by Joseph Cornell" (December 1946).  He designed the exhibition catalog for this show, which consisted of portraits - box constructions, objects, and "dossiers" - of the opera singers, Giuditta Pasta and Maria Malibran, the ballerinas, Taglioni and Cerrito, and the actresses, Eleanora Duse, Jeanne Eagels, Greta Garbo, and Jennifer Jones, and which also featured one of his most famous boxes, <emph render="italic">Untitled (Penny Arcade Portrait of Lauren Bacall)</emph> (1945-46).</p>
<p>In 1949, Cornell joined the Egan Gallery, which was run by Charles Egan.  Around this time, he began creating his series of Aviary boxes, which explored the symbolism of birds and birdcages.  He showed twenty-six of these box constructions in his first exhibition at the Egan Gallery, "Aviary by Joseph Cornell" (December 1949-January 1950).  He created other series of whitewashed boxes, including the Dovecote series and a small group relating to the poet, Emily Dickinson.  He then went on to explore the themes of astronomy and celestial navigation in the Observatory, Night Skies, and Hotel series.  Works from these series were featured in his two remaining shows at the Egan Gallery, "Night Songs and Other Work" (December 1950-January 1951) and "Night Voyage" (February-March 1953).  In the fall of 1953, sparked by seeing the painting, <emph render="italic">Figure Seated in a Cafe</emph> (1914), Cornell embarked upon a major series of bird constructions dedicated to the Cubist artist, Juan Gris.  Notably, these were the only boxes he explicitly dedicated to another artist.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of years, Cornell's work was exhibited across the country.  In 1955, he joined the Stable Gallery, which was run by Eleanor Ward.  His first one-man show there, in the winter of 1955-56, was "Winter Night Skies," which featured various box constructions based on constellations.  During the mid-1950s, he embarked upon a series of Sand Fountains (vertical standing boxes featuring a broken glass and sand that flowed through it when turned upside down), elaborating upon his earlier Sand Boxes (1940s).  These boxes along with some of his other latest works, including the Bleriot boxes and the Space Object boxes (which comprised his final box series), were exhibited in his second and last show at the Stable Gallery, "Selected Works" (December 1957).</p>
<p>After leaving the Stable Gallery, Cornell had several dealers handle his work rather than allowing any one to assume too much control.  Dealers included Richard Feigen (in Chicago and then in New York) and Irving Blum (in California), among others.   Throughout his career, Cornell never liked selling his boxes.  He was always reluctant to let his work go and became increasingly uneasy about the growing status of his work as a commodity.  He preferred instead to make gifts of his art work to friends and individuals he admired (especially female ones).</p>
<p>In the mid-1950s, Cornell returned to making films.  Rather than just splicing together found images as he had in his films of the 1930s, he began to collaborate with others to shoot original footage.  He worked with the experimental filmmaker, Stan Brakhage, on two films, one about the Third Ave El which was about to be torn down (<emph render="italic">Wonder Ring</emph> or <emph render="italic">Gnir Rednow</emph>) and the other about an old house in Cornell's neighborhood that was slated for demolition (<emph render="italic">Centuries of June</emph>).  Cornell then went on to make nine films with the filmmaker, Rudy Burckhardt, including <emph render="italic">Aviary</emph>, <emph render="italic">A Legend for Fountains</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Nymphlight</emph>, among others.  In the late 1960s, he enlisted the help of Larry Jordan, who was also a filmmaker, in completing the trilogy of collage-films that he had begun in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Along with creating works of art and making films, Cornell was involved in a host of other creative endeavors throughout his career as an artist.  These included: keeping a diary, which was for him another medium for exploring and expressing the themes, ideas, and concerns recurrent in his art work; carrying out "explorations," which typically involved conducting research, collecting material, and compiling files on persons or topics of interest to him; and other projects, such as publishing pamphlets (or brochures) dedicated to the nineteenth-century opera singers, Malibran and Giulia Grisi.  Cornell's "explorations" clearly informed his artwork, but they were also works of art in and of themselves.  He continually sought to share this work with an audience and twice had the opportunity to do so, when he exhibited versions of his <emph render="italic">Portrait of Ondine</emph> "exploration" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1945 and at the Wittenborn Bookstore in 1956.</p>
<p>Around the mid-1950s, Cornell returned to making collages as independent works of art. Unlike his earlier ones, which were composed from cutouts of black-and-white engravings, his latest collages were made with color images cut out of contemporary magazines and books.  In these collages, he explored many of the same themes and preoccupations of his box constructions, including birds, as in <emph render="italic">Couleur de Peche</emph> (1967) and <emph render="italic">Untitled (Vierge Vivace)</emph> (1970), children's games, as in the Penny Arcade series (1960s), and actresses, as in <emph render="italic">The Sister Shades</emph> (1956).  Towards the end of his career, collage became his principal medium.</p>
<p>By this time, Cornell was taking fewer trips into Manhattan.  Instead, he spent more time at home or traveled only so far as downtown Flushing, where he frequented the public library, hunted for material in stores, such as Woolworth's, and passed time in the coffee-shops on Main Street.  From this time on, he kept his diary with increasing regularity, taking down notations with more frequency and creating entries of greater length.</p>
<p>In 1961, fourteen of Cornell's boxes, including <emph render="italic">Medici Slot Machine</emph>, were exhibited as part of the "The Art of Assemblage" show at the Museum of Modern Art.  As his biographer notes, Cornell came to view this show "as a turning point in his creative life," marking the "[fall] off in his work" that took place in the sixties (Solomon 271-2).  He continued to work on boxes that he had begun long before, but, after this time, rarely if ever constructed new ones.  Instead, he focused on making collages and became increasingly concerned with other projects, such as organizing his basement workshop, for which he hired various "helpers" or assistants (mostly young women) over the years.  He also became more and more prone to obsessions (or preoccupations, as he called them) with various young women that he encountered both in fantasy (actresses on stage or in films) and in real life (working girls in the city, "teeners" on Main Street, or his female visitors and "helpers" at home).  These preoccupations infused his diary writings, and inspired the keeping of "dossiers" on particular individuals and the creation of various collages dedicated to others, including most notably the Penny Arcade series dedicated to Joyce Hunter (or "Tina," as he referred to her in his writings).</p>
<p>After Robert's death in February 1965, Cornell created a series of collages in his memory, many of which incorporated his brother's drawings of animal characters.  In January 1966, he exhibited some of these collages, alongside a selection of Robert's drawings, in a show at the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery, "Robert Cornell: Memorial Exhibition."  In 1967, there were two retrospective exhibitions of Cornell's work, "An Exhibition of Works by Joseph Cornell" at the Pasadena Art Museum and "Joseph Cornell" at the Guggenheim Museum.  By now, Cornell was receiving considerable public recognition for his work.  He had received his first profile (by Howard Griffin) in the December 1957 issue of <emph render="italic">Art News</emph> and, ten years later, was treated to a 12-page spread (by David Bourdon) in the December 1967 issue of <emph render="italic">Life</emph> magazine.  He was also the recipient of various prizes for his art work, including the M.V Kohnstamm Prize at the Art Institute of Chicago's "62nd American Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture" in 1957 and the winning prize in India's first Triennale of Contemporary World Art in 1968.</p>
<p>In the last years of his life (especially from the time of his mother's death in the fall of 1966), Cornell suffered from severe depression and loneliness, and withdrew even further from the outside world.  However, he still maintained relationships with various young friends and artists, who frequently visited Utopia Parkway and/or served as one of his assistants.  He became more and more interested in sharing his work with a younger audience and his last two exhibitions in 1972 were expressly for children, "A Joseph Cornell Exhibition for Children" at the Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture and "Joseph Cornell - Collages and Boxes" at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>Cornell continued to work until the end of his life, "refurbishing" earlier boxes and creating memorial collages.  Following prostate surgery in June 1972, he spent several months recuperating with family in Westhampton before returning to Utopia Parkway in November.  He died of heart failure at home on December 29, 1972.</p>
<p>The biographical note draws heavily from Deborah Solomon's biography, <emph render="italic">Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell</emph> (New York: Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 1997), and Diane Waldman's book, <emph render="italic">Joseph Cornell: Master of Dreams</emph> (New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2002).</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Joseph Cornell papers measure approximately 24.5 linear feet and date from 1804 to 1986, with the bulk of the material dating from 1939-1972.  The collection documents the life, work, interests, and creative activities of the self-taught artist, who was best known for his shadow box constructions, assemblages, and collages.  Papers include correspondence, diaries, source material, notes, writings, photographs, printed material, two- and three-dimensional ephemera, art works, and books, as well as a limited amount of legal and financial records, and some miscellaneous personal and family papers (which comprise a series of biographical material).  The collection also includes the papers of his sister, Betty Cornell Benton, relating to the handling of Cornell's estate and the personal papers of his brother, Robert Cornell.</p>
<p>Cornell's correspondence is typically with family, friends, artists, dealers, collectors, galleries, museums, admirers, individuals whom he admired, "helpers," and various charitable institutions.  Correspondence generally concerns the creation, exhibition, sale, and reception of Cornell's art work; his "explorations" and other research and collecting activities; his preoccupations with certain individuals and motifs; his usual practices of giving gifts of art work to those he liked or admired and making donations to charities in aid of those less fortunate; and his relationships and shared interests with family, friends, and colleagues.  Also found is correspondence between and amongst various other members of the Cornell family, including, most notably, Robert Cornell's letters to his sisters, Elizabeth (typically addressed as Nell) and Helen.</p>
<p>Dating from 1941 to 1972, Cornell's diaries span almost the entirety of his career as an artist, which began in earnest when he left his job at the Traphagen textile studio in 1940 to pursue art full-time and ended with his death in 1972.  The diaries record his day-to-day experiences (usually comprising his thoughts, feelings, impressions, and ideas); and reflect on his various art projects (boxes, films, and collages) and creative activities ("explorations," and various other research, collecting, and publishing ventures).  They also explore many of the themes and underlying concerns of his art work; and document his intense preoccupations with certain individuals, his wide-ranging interests, and the interconnectedness of his ideas and activities.  Cornell's style of writing in the diaries tends to be stream-of-conscious with entries being composed of phrases, rather than complete sentences and with the progression of passages being more poetic and associative than either logical or narrative.  He tended to compose by hand, occasionally typing up his notes into more formal entries, and also to use abbreviations for oft-repeated words and initials for individuals.  At times, his handwriting can be difficult to read, and his references can be difficult to decipher.  It was also common practice for him to review or revisit previous entries at various points in time, often making revisions or comments on them with dated annotations in the margins or on the reverse side of a page.</p>
<p>Cornell's source material is largely comprised of files of newspaper and magazine clippings, cutouts, notes, writings, book excerpts, photostats (or stats), prints, postcards, art reproductions, and other printed material.  Some files are devoted to people (ballerinas, actresses, singers, artists, and writers) and topics (astronomy, romantic and modern ballet, birds, films, literature, music, plants, and science, among others).  Other files relate to specific art works, "explorations," publishing projects, and exhibitions.  Source material documents Cornell's preoccupation with certain individuals (past and present), events, subjects, and motifs; the development of some of his major "explorations" and their influence on his various artistic and commercial projects; and his work on certain box constructions and collages, publishing ventures, and exhibition catalogues.  Source material also sheds light on Cornell's efforts to gain access to the past; his interest in the symbolism of images and objects; the linkages he found between seemingly unrelated things; and the connections between his many creative endeavors.</p>
<p>Ephemera and artifacts include various objects, mementos, and items of memorabilia, some of which were accumulated by Cornell (in much the same way that he collected his source material) and some of which are of uncertain origin.  For Cornell, items such as these were not merely inanimate objects, but were instead evocative of past worlds and capable of bringing the past into the present (an idea which he often expressed in his diaries as the "metaphysique d'ephemera").  He seems to have used some of these items in a layout he designed for <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping</emph>.  Other items may have been used as source material for some of his box constructions.</p>
<p>The collection also houses photographs of Cornell, his family, art work, other artists, and friends, as well as photographs taken by various individuals and publicity photographs from the New York City Ballet.  Also found are scattered works of art, including collage fragments and Rorschachs (or ink blot drawings) by Cornell, collages by Cornell's sister, Betty Cornell Benton, on which he collaborated, and a box by Christine Kaufman, which was a gift to Cornell.  The books in the collection most likely comprise the remainder of Cornell's library, which was transferred to the Joseph Cornell Study Center, and include some that seem to have belonged to his sister, Betty.  Printed material includes various publications and clippings collected by Cornell apart from that which he collected as source material.  Writings about Cornell include an article by the poet, Mina Loy, and copies of various theses, presentations, and articles by graduate students in art history received by Benton (who assisted them in their research).</p>
<p>The Joseph Cornell Estate Papers consist of correspondence relating to Betty Cornell Benton's administration of the part of Cornell's estate for which she was responsible and legal documents relating to her various legal disputes with the executors of the estate, as well as a limited amount of printed material, some of which was originally accumulated by Cornell and subsequently shared with Benton, and miscellaneous papers belonging to Benton and their mother, Helen S. Cornell.  Estate Papers provide insight on the exhibition and sale of Cornell art works after his death; the disposition of his belongings (including art work, papers, books, records, and source material); and Benton's efforts to foster and safeguard the memory and legacy of Cornell.  The Robert Cornell Papers include correspondence, writings, art works, photographs, printed material, and scattered financial and personal records, documenting the full and creative life Robert led despite being confined to a wheelchair.  Their inclusion in the collection suggests the family's effort to foster Robert's memory.</p>

<head>Provenance</head>
<p>The Joseph Cornell papers were donated and microfilmed in several installments from 1974 to 1989 by Joseph Cornell's sister, Betty Cornell Benton.  Most, but not all, of the correspondence, which was loaned for microfilming in 1974, was subsequently donated in 1989.  Additional material was donated in 2004 by the Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation.</p>

<head>Separated Material</head>
<p>The bulk of Cornell's source material resides in the Joseph Cornell Study Center, Smithsonian American Art Museum, along with his library and record collection.  Cornell's sister, Betty Cornell Benton, donated a portion of this material directly to SAAM (then known as the National Museum of American Art), occasioning the creation of the Study Center circa 1978.  The bulk of the source material and library that she donated to AAA, including approximately 66 linear feet of three-dimensional and non-textual source material and 50 linear feet of books, was transferred to the Study Center in 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>Originals of loaned material returned to the donor after microfilming include: some unidentified and miscellaneous correspondence; significant correspondence between Joseph Cornell and Helen S. Cornell; significant correspondence between Helen S. Cornell, family members and others; and some of Joseph Cornell's family correspondence and general correspondence from the Robert Cornell papers. The loaned material is available on microfilm reels 1055-1058 but is not described further in the Series Descriptions/Container Listing of this finding aid.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Series is comprised of Cornell's personal and professional correspondence, primarily consisting of letters, postcards, and greeting cards to Cornell from family, friends, artists, dealers, collectors, galleries, museums, admirers, "helpers," and charitable institutions.  Also included, to a lesser extent, are letters between and amongst other members of the Cornell family.  While Cornell did not usually make copies of his outgoing correspondence, he often wrote various versions of a letter.  Several examples of these can be found amongst his correspondence, though it is unclear whether or not they represent letters that were actually sent.  Files also include notes and printed material that pertain to various (often notable) individuals and/or institutions.  Though most likely not actual correspondents, these individuals and institutions were of interest to Cornell in one way or another, which presumably led him to collect this material.  Based upon this collecting activity, there is some overlap between correspondence and source material.  Correspondence relating to Cornell and his artwork can be found amongst his estate papers.</p> 
<p>In general, the correspondence is heavily annotated by Cornell's sister, Betty Cornell Benton, who prepared his papers for donation to the Archives.  In her annotations, Benton often supplies the last name of the correspondent and sometimes the date of the letter when these are not provided.  Other times, she provides information about or commentary on the correspondent and his/her relations with Cornell.</p>
<p>According to some of Benton's annotations, it seems likely that Cornell may have originally maintained some, if not all, of his correspondence in chronological files.  At some point, correspondence was organized alphabetically according to the surname of the correspondent or name of institution.  It is not clear whether this was carried out by Cornell, his sister, or someone in the Archives.  The existing alphabetical organization has been maintained since, with so many undated letters, it would be impossible to reconstruct a meaningful chronological order.</p>
</scopecontent>

<arrangement><p>In the existing arrangement, general correspondence, family correspondence, and greeting cards were maintained separately in distinct groupings of files.  Based upon this, the Correspondence series is arranged as three subseries:</p> 
<p>
<list> 
<item>2.1: General Correspondence, 1909-1982</item> 
<item>2.2: Family Correspondence, 1909-1977</item>
<item>2.3: Greeting Cards, 1956-1972</item>

</arrangement>

<c02 level="subseries"><did><unitid>2.1: </unitid>
<unittitle>General Correspondence,<unitdate> 1909-1982</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries consists of correspondence between Cornell and friends, artists, dealers, collectors, galleries, museums, admirers, individuals whom he admired or with whom he was especially preoccupied, "helpers," and charitable institutions.  Included are letters (in some instances, with photographs or poems enclosed), postcards, and greeting cards, as well as some art work, three-dimensional objects, and artifacts.  Also included are some notes and printed material, such as newspaper and magazine clippings, pamphlets, brochures, publications, and publicity material, pertaining to individuals, institutions, and/or topics in which Cornell had a particular interest.</p>
<p>Correspondence documents some of Cornell's activities involved in creating his art work, such as his practice of using multiple copies of a single image in many of his works (as in a letter from John Allen referring to Cornell's order for multiple prints of a Loie Fuller image); his early attempts to advertise his art work (as in letters from the Blaker Advertising Agency, Columbia Records, Inc., and N. W. Ayer and Son); and his later, oftentimes hesitant, transactions with galleries and dealers, including Irving Blum, Charles Egan, Richard Feigen, Julien Levy, Robert Schoelkopf, and Eleanor Ward (<emph render="italic">See also</emph> Series 1).  Correspondence relates to the sale of his art work to galleries and individual collectors, and the exhibition of his art work in museums, including the Cleveland Museum of Art, Guggenheim Museum (<emph render="italic">See</emph> Diane Waldman and Tom Messer), Pasadena Art Museum, and Whitney Museum (<emph render="italic">See also</emph> John Baur).</p>
<p>The positive reception of Cornell's art work is documented in many letters from admirers (including poet, Paul Carroll, who wrote two poems about Cornell's art work, the Fourth Grade Class at Murray Avenue School, actress, Eva Marie Saint, and author, Glenway Wescott, among others).  The critical reception of Cornell's art work is documented in the many letters from people who have written or express interest in writing an article about Cornell (including Howard Griffin from <emph render="italic">Art News</emph>, David Bourdon from <emph render="italic">Life</emph> magazine, and Brian O'Doherty, author of <emph render="italic">American Masters: The Voice and the Myth</emph>, among others).</p>
<p>Correspondence also concerns some of Cornell's major "explorations," including ones on the singers, Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta (as in letters from the English scholar, Richard Coe), and the ballerina, Fanny Cerrito (as in letters from Lillian Moore).  Correspondence relates to his other research and collecting activities and includes numerous letters responding to his requests for information and/or material from institutions, such as the Harvard College Library, dealers, such as C. and I. K. Fletcher, and individuals, such as Marian Hannah Winter.</p>
<p>Correspondence documents Cornell's preoccupations with certain dancers (such as Allegra Kent, Tanaquil LeClerq, and Tamara Toumanova), actresses (such as Lois Smith), artists (Lee Bontecou), and other young women; his relationships with other artists, both young and established, including Piero Dorazio, Ray Johnson, Hubert Kappel, Roberto Matta Echauren, Dorothea Tanning, and Pavel Tchelitchew, among others; and his friendships and shared interests with individuals, such as Wayne Andrews, Charles Henri Ford, Parker Tyler, Donald Windham, and Marian Hannah Winter (their letters often entailing an exchange of ideas on topics such as literature, music, dance, art, and the pleasures of collecting).  Correspondence also documents his generosity (in terms of gift giving) toward his friends (and their children) and individuals whom he admired (as in letters and notes of thanks for gifts of art work from Valerie Adams, George Bennette, Lee Bontecou, Susan Sontag, Jessica Tandy, and Tamara Toumanova, among others); and his generosity toward institutions providing public services to the less fortunate (as in letters acknowledging and expressing gratitude for donations from the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind and the Bedside Network, among others).</p>
<p>General correspondence is arranged in files according to correspondent and then alphabetically according the surname of the individual or the name of the institution.  Items are arranged in rough chronological order within each file.  When only a few items (typically less than three) are associated with a correspondent, these are arranged into general alphabetical files.  Unidentified and miscellaneous items are arranged into files at the end of the subseries.</p>

<unittitle>Family Correspondence,<unitdate> 1909-1977</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries consists of correspondence between Cornell and various members of his immediate family, including his mother, Helen S. Cornell, his sisters, Betty Cornell Benton (often addressed as Nell) and Helen Jagger, his nieces, Sissy (Jagger) Batcheller and Jean (Jagger) Plitt, and various cousins.  Some printed material, primarily clippings sent to Cornell by his mother while she was living in Westhampton during her last years, can also be found.  Subseries also consists of correspondence between and amongst other members of the family, including many of those listed above, as well as Cornell's brother, Robert (subseries includes only correspondence from him), his father, Joseph I. Cornell, and his cousins, Grace Sayres and Janet (Voorhis) Traphagen.  Correspondence received by Robert Cornell can be found amongst his papers in Series 11.</p>
<p>Cornell's family correspondence documents his close and on-going relationships with his mother, sisters, and nieces; the large role that his family played in both his personal and creative life; the many interests he shared with his siblings, including art, literature, music, and Christian Science; and his collaborative work on collages with his sister, Betty.  The one important family relationship not explicitly documented in the correspondence is Cornell's relationship with his brother, Robert.  Since they lived together up until the month before Robert died, they did not exchange letters in a regular fashion.  Some cards and notes between the two are scattered amongst Cornell's personal papers and diaries, as well as amongst Robert's papers.  To a certain extent, Cornell's diary entries also document his relationship with his brother.</p>
<p>Family correspondence files are arranged alphabetically according to the surname of the correspondent.  Items within the files are arranged in rough chronological order.</p>

<did><unitid>Series 3: </unitid><unittitle>Diaries,<unitdate> 1941-1973</unitdate></unittitle>
<physdesc>(boxes 6-10; 5 linear feet)</physdesc></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Series is comprised of Cornell's diaries, which are unconventional in form, consisting of entries, notes, and writings recorded on loose sheets and scraps of paper, as well as in the margins of newspapers, on the backs of used envelopes, on creased paper bags, napkins, labels, train tickets, library slips, blank telegram forms, calling cards, and parts of bakery boxes.  Included are other items, such as <emph render="italic">TV Guide</emph> pages, dried leaves and flowers, cutouts, plastic and metal objects, and a part of a whisk broom, collected by Cornell presumably because they related, in one way or another, to what he was recording.</p>
<p>Diaries record Cornell's day-to-day experiences (sometimes in very minute detail), with allusions to: the books he read, the music he listened to, the films he watched, and the many "sparkings" he received from them; his various finds ("trouvailles") while hunting for material; his thoughts and practices relating to Christian Science; the meals and snacks he ate; the places he went and the sights he saw during his city wanderings; the evocations brought on by ordinary, everyday things; the tensions at home; the people who visited him; the "teeners," "fees," and other women who captured his imagination; his dreamings and awakenings; and his thoughts, feelings, impressions, and ideas during the course of a day.</p> 
<p>Diaries also record and reflect on Cornell's various art projects, with references to particular box constructions, box series, collages, and films on which he is working, and to ideas and inspirations for new projects, as well as some commentary on his chosen mediums, the creative process, and the final products.  They explore many of the themes that recur in Cornell's art work, including, among others, his fascination with actresses and ballerinas of the past and present, and his abiding appreciation of birds, the night sky, and nature.  They also reflect on many of the ideas and concerns underlying his art work and other creative activities, such as his preoccupation with the past, his notions of "metaphysique d'ephemera" (the metaphysical aspects of ephemera) and "the beauty of the commonplace," and his concern to recapture past experiences in his art works and other projects.</p>  
<p>Diaries record and reflect on Cornell's wide-ranging "explorations," ranging from <emph render="italic">GC 44</emph> (with references to his initial experiences during the time he was working at the Garden Centre nursery, and to his subsequent and on-going attempts to recreate the flavor and atmosphere of those days) to <emph render="italic">Portrait of Ondine</emph> (with references to the early inspirations of discovering a portrait of Fanny Cerrito and of seeing a vision of her in a warehouse window, and to his later efforts to compile and create an "unauthorized biography" of the ballerina).  They also refer to his many other creative activities, including various research and collecting ventures, such as regular browsing in secondhand book stalls and stores, visits to the library, accumulating material and compiling files on people and topics; and various publishing ventures, such as his contributions to <emph render="italic">Dance Index</emph> and <emph render="italic">View</emph>, and his self-publications, <emph render="italic">Maria</emph> and <emph render="italic">Bel Canto Pet</emph>.  They comment on the act of keeping a diary, expressing many times over some of Cornell's deepest concerns about the necessity and difficulty of trying to capture experience "before it fades" and the discrepancy between the original experience and the "cataloguing" of it in writing.</p> 
<p>Diaries document Cornell's on-going preoccupations with certain historical and cultural figures, such as the ballerinas, Marie Taglioni and Fanny Cerrito, the singers, Maria Malibran and Raquel Meller, various composers (from Mozart to Satie), the author, Gerard de Nerval, the artists, Delacroix and Vermeer, and various actresses of stage and screen (from Jeanne Eagels to Claire Bloom).  Later diaries are taken up with Cornell's episodic preoccupations with various young women he encountered along Main Street (waitresses and shopgirls) or at home ("helpers," young artists, and friends).</p>

<arrangement><p>Distinguishing between consistently dated material that was organized into chronological files and mostly undated material that was organized into bulk files, the Diaries series is arranged into two subseries:</p> 
<p>
<list> 
<item>3.1: Diary Entries, 1941-1972</item> 
<item>3.2: Diary Notations, 1941-1973</item>
</list>

<p>This series has been scanned in entirety.</p>

<c02 level="subseries"><did><unitid>3.1: </unitid>
<unittitle>Diary Entries,<unitdate> 1941-1972</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries consists of files of consistently dated entries, notes, writings, and other material.  The files, which comprise the vast majority of the series, are arranged chronologically according to how Cornell likely accumulated, maintained, and used them.  The bulk of the entries are hand-written, though typed entries are common during the period from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s.  The extent of the diaries, both in number and length of entries, increases with each year Cornell kept them.  In the later diaries, it is not uncommon to find several entries for a given day.  </p> 
<p>The file descriptions below are meant to provide researchers with some sense of the contents of Cornell's diary entries, but are by no means exhaustive.</p>

<physdesc>(boxes 11-18, 25-28, OV 29; 8.5 linear feet)</physdesc></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Series consists of Cornell's two-dimensional and textual source material and is largely comprised of files of clippings, notes, writings, stats, cutouts, and other printed material, stemming from his various artistic, research, writing, collecting, and collating activities.  Some files are devoted to people and topics.  Other files relate to specific art works, publishing projects, and exhibitions, as well as to his "explorations" in dance, music, art, science, and nature, among other topics, and his more personal "explorations" based on particular experiences and dreams.  His typical practice involved accumulating massive amounts of material and information, which he would then collate into files, portfolios, or albums, continually adding to and refining them.  Cornell seems to have used his source material as both raw material and inspiration for various creations, ranging from boxes and collages to design layouts for magazines and announcements for exhibitions of his work.</p>
<p>Source material sheds light on Cornell's preoccupations with certain people, events, subjects, and motifs.  It documents his work on certain art works, publishing ventures, and exhibition catalogues, as well as the evolution of some of his major "explorations" from original experience or idea to the completion of one or more art works, and the various stages of other "explorations" that may or may not have resulted in a finished product.  Source material also documents the influence of his preoccupations and "explorations" on his various artistic and commercial projects, as well as some of the major themes that recur in his art work.  Source material reflects Cornell's efforts to gain access to the past and bring it into the present; his wide-ranging interests and the linkages he found between seemingly unrelated ideas and things; his real and imaginary relationships with historical and contemporary figures (such as artists and ballerinas); his abiding interest in the symbolism of images and objects; and the interconnectedness of his many artistic and creative endeavors.</p>
<p>The bulk of Cornell's source material, especially three-dimensional and non-textual material, can be found in the Joseph Cornell Study Center, Smithsonian American Art Museum, along with his library and record collection.  Related material can also be found in Series 5: Ephemera and Artifacts.</p>
</scopecontent>

<arrangement><p>In the source material found amongst Cornell's papers, a distinction can be made between his files on people and topics, as well as between the files and portfolios.  While he variously referred to his files as "dossiers," "compilations," "source files" "portfolios," and "albums" (among other terms), he seems to have primarily used the term "dossier" to refer to his files on people and the term "source files" more generally; in addition, his use of the term "portfolio" seems to refer more particularly to the material maintained in portfolio cases.  Distinguishing between the different types of files and material while retaining some of Cornell's own terminology, the Source Material series is arranged into three subseries:</p> 
<p>
<list> 
<item>4.1: Dossiers, 1941-1971</item> 
<item>4.2: Portfolios, 1831-1957</item>
<item>4.3: Subject Source Files, 1804-1972</item> 
</list> 
</p>
<p>The bulk of this series has been digitized with the exception of books, magazines and exhibition catalogs for artists other than Cornell; typically only covers, title pages, and/or relevant pages of these items have been digitized.</p>
</arrangement>

<c02 level="subseries"><did><unitid>4.1: </unitid>
<unittitle>Dossiers,<unitdate> 1941-1971</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries is comprised of Cornell's files ("dossiers") on people, including those in whom he had a particular interest and those with whom he identified or felt some sort of connection, whether real or imagined. People typically include historical and contemporary dancers (especially ballerinas), stage and film actresses, singers, artists, and writers.  Dossiers are devoted to a particular individual and consist primarily of notes, writings, book and typed excerpts, prints, stats, clippings, correspondence, art work, and printed material.</p>
<p>Dossiers generally relate to Cornell's "explorations" in ballet, music, art, literature, film, and theater, and to his particular preoccupations with ballerinas and opera singers from the Romantic era (including Marie Taglioni and Maria Malibran, respectively), with contemporary ballerinas and singers (including Renee "Zizi" Jeanmarie and Anna Moffo, respectively), with stage and film actresses (including Claire Bloom, Patty Duke, Jeanne Eagels, and Jennifer Jones), and with the work of other artists (including Johannes Vermeer) and writers.  Dossiers document the development of these and other preoccupations, which typically began with some sort of encounter (such as seeing Duke perform in the play, <emph render="italic">Isle of Children</emph>, reading about Taglioni's performance in the ballet, <emph render="italic">La Sylphide</emph>, or coming across a reproduction of a Vermeer painting in a book or on a postcard) and came to involve extensive contemplation and writing.  Dossiers also relate to certain art works and other creative projects arising from these particular "explorations" and preoccupations, including the various boxes and collages he made in tribute to Duke, Jeanmarie, Tilly Losch, and others, his self-publications (<emph render="italic">Maria</emph> and <emph render="italic">Bel Canto Pet</emph>) dedicated to the opera singers, Malibran and Grisi, and the planned brochure (<emph render="italic">La Retour de la Sylphide</emph>) dedicated to the ballerina, Taglioni. </p>
<p>Dossiers document his personal contact with certain individuals with whom he was preoccupied (such as meeting Jeanmarie in her dressing room after a show and getting her autograph), and his imaginary involvement with others (such as the connection he felt with Bloom after discovering that, as a young girl, she had lived with her family in Forest Hills, New York during the same time period that he was working nearby).  Dossiers also concern his relationships with other artists, including Lee Bontecou, Dorothy Coulter, Piero Dorazio, Yayoi Kusama, Tilly Losch (who was primarily known as a dancer and actress), and Robert Motherwell, as well as his relationship with the actor, Tony Curtis and his wife, Christine Kaufman.  Many of these relationships are also documented in Cornell's correspondence.</p>

<unittitle>Portfolios,<unitdate> 1831-1957</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries is comprised of portfolios devoted to two of Cornell's on-going "explorations," "Ondine (Cerrito)" and "Romantic Ballet."  Portfolios consist of oversized and document-sized material, including notes, book and typed excerpts, stats, clippings, lithograph portraits, prints, sheet music, writings, and other printed material.  Portfolio titles are drawn from the inscriptions on the outside of each portfolio case.  Cornell more than likely compiled this material in much the same way as that in his other files, though he ended up storing and maintaining it separately due perhaps to the size of certain items.</p>
<p>The "Ondine (Cerrito)" Portfolio represents some of the material that Cornell created and accumulated in the course of working on <emph render="italic">Portrait of Ondine</emph>, his "exploration" (or "unauthorized biography") of Fanny Cerrito and her famous role in the ballet, <emph render="italic">Ondine</emph>.  Portfolio includes material, such as exhibition text and notes, relating to the exhibitions of versions of <emph render="italic">Portrait of Ondine</emph> at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946 and at the Wittenborn Bookstore in 1956 (<emph render="italic">See also</emph> Subseries 4.3); and notes indicating Cornell's desire and/or intention to present this "exploration" in another format.  Portfolio also includes material on Marie Taglioni, and other material (such as a typed manuscript of Cornell's essay on Hedy Lamarr for <emph render="italic">View</emph>) that may or may not correspond to the same "exploration."</p>
<p>The "Romantic Ballet" Portfolio consists of material on ballet dancers, Marie Taglioni and Tamara Toumanova, and opera singers, Maria Malibran, Pauline Viardot-Garcia, and Giuditta Pasta.  It is unclear whether all the material relates directly to the Romantic Ballet "exploration," but it seems possible that Cornell was able to find linkages between Romantic and contemporary ballerinas, as well as between ballerinas and opera singers.  The name of 'Gautier' inscribed on the portfolio suggests that the figure of Theophile Gautier may have been a thread linking this broad exploration.  Portfolio includes material relating to a proposed "Taglioni-Poe project," which Cornell at one point intended to publish in the avant-garde periodical, <emph render="italic">Possibilities</emph> (<emph render="italic">See also</emph> the Motherwell dossier for correspondence mentioning the project); a version of his Toumanova Ballet Scrapbook and swan prints that seem to relate to the <emph render="italic">Swan Lake</emph> shadow boxes he made in tribute to her; and writings on Viardot-Garcia that trace a "Turgenev-St. Saens thread" and establish a connection between the opera singer and his box, <emph render="italic">Parrot for Juan Gris</emph>.</p>
<p>Dossiers and Subject Source Files include files relating to some of the same people and topics, as well as to some of the same, or similar, projects.</p>

<unittitle>Subject Source Files,<unitdate> 1804-1972</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries is comprised of Cornell's files on various subjects, including topics of interest to him, themes, "explorations," art and publishing projects, and exhibitions.  Some files are organized according to format, such as clippings, notes and writings, and stamps.  Files typically consist of material that Cornell used in creating particular boxes, collages, and other works (design layouts and exhibition announcements, among others), and from which he drew ideas and inspiration for projects.  Material typically includes magazine and newspaper clippings, cutouts, notes, writings, book and typed excerpts, stats, prints, postcards, art reproductions, and other printed material.</p>
<p>Subject source files range from slender files containing only clippings and cutouts of a particular subject (such as Butterflies, Food, and Statues) to files of assorted printed material seemingly related to some sort of titled, but not easily identifiable, project (such as "Animals in the News," "Earth Before the Flood" Box, and "La Malaga") to voluminous files relating to a particular topic, which Cornell explored in depth, or to an on-going project, which may or may not have resulted in a finished product (such as "Celestial Theater" and "GC 44").  Some files are more comprehensive than others; some files relate directly, and others only indirectly, to particular projects; and some files are so general and/or incomplete that it is not entirely clear how they relate to Cornell's projects or interests.</p>
<p>Certain subject source files relate to Cornell's "explorations" on such diverse topics as astronomy, ballet, literature, and music.  Ones on astronomy include "Cassiopeia" (sparked by his musings on the constellation and his preoccupation with a young waitress) and "Celestial Theater" (an unfinished project on sky-gazing).  Ones on ballet and literature include "Portrait of Ondine (Cerrito)" and the Bibliomania projects, respectively.  And ones on music include "The Caliph of Bagdad" (sparked by hearing the opera by Francois-Andrien Boieldieu and leading to the creation of one or more Cockatoo boxes), "Famagouste" (inspired by the opera, "La Pisanella" by Ildebrando Pizzetti), and "Rossiniana" (involving a proposed "feuilleton-project" on the composer, Rossini).</p>
<p>Other subject source files relate to particular "explorations" based on Cornell's personal experiences.  Most notable among these is "GC 44," which stemmed from events during the period when he worked at the Garden Centre nursery in Flushing.  The extensive "GC 44" files document the core experiences of this "exploration," which included visits to "The Old Farm" (Lawrence Homestead), a dream of "the little dancer," many trips to the "house on the hill" (where Cornell gathered dried grasses which were used in his <emph render="italic">Habitat</emph> boxes), and a particular sighting of a delivery truck "with its enseigne of the fish and smoking meats" which inspired "The Floral Still-Life" musings.  Also documented are Cornell's overriding concerns to recapture and recreate what was for him "one of the high tides of inspiration" and to share the experience with others.  Though he exchanged ideas and shared some of this material with others (<emph render="italic">See</emph> letter from Donald Windham to Betty Cornell Benton in Series 10), the project, as he imagined it, was never completed.</p>
<p>Some subject source files relate to particular art projects and stem from Cornell's work researching, planning, and/or creating certain box constructions, box series, and collages.  While by no means comprehensive or complete, files on art projects variously document the origin of certain box series (such as the Aviary and Juan Gris series) and/or stages in the development of particular boxes and collages (such as the "Nostalgia of the Sea" box, and the Rabbit and "Tina" collages).  Files on art projects also suggest the way in which Cornell's preoccupations influenced his art work, as in the box, "The Bird with the Shoe-Button Eyes," which stemmed from his preoccupations with literature in general and with the French author, Gerard de Nerval, in particular and which he seems to have conceived as a means to bring the rather obscure author to the attention of a wider audience.</p>
<p>Certain subject source files relate to particular publishing projects and stem from Cornell's work designing covers and illustrations, writing articles, and planning entire issues for various commercial and avant-garde periodicals (<emph render="italic">See</emph> Subseries 4.1 for his work on self-publications).  Notable publishing projects documented, in part, here include "The Crystal Cage [portrait of Berenice]," and various pieces for <emph render="italic">Dance Index</emph>, including ones on "blackface ballerinas," children and ballet, and dancing animals, as well as the thematic issue, "Clowns, Elephants, and Ballerinas" (1946).</p>
<p>Subject source files on exhibitions stem primarily from Cornell's work on catalogues for the "Objects by Joseph Cornell" exhibition at the Copley Gallery (September 1948), the "Night Voyage" exhibition at the Egan Gallery (February 10-March 28, 1953), and the "Romantic Museum at the Hugo Gallery: Portraits of Women" exhibition (December 1946), and they document, to a certain extent, his involvement in the presentation, exhibition, and sale of his art work.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that Cornell maintained these files in alphabetical order.  Betty Cornell Benton's correspondence indicates that she organized some of his papers (<emph render="italic">See</emph> Series 10), so it seems likely that this order was imposed by her.  At this point, it is difficult to surmise what, if any, Cornell's original organization may have been.  Therefore, files have been left in alphabetical order.</p>

<physdesc>(boxes 18, 23; 0.8 linear feet)</physdesc></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Series consists of various items of ephemera and memorabilia, and various artifacts.  Included are Victorian cards, an album of remembrance with entries by various individuals who were friends and acquaintances of the original owner, an autograph book, cartes-de-visite, dried flowers from Lawrence farm, cabinet cards (including one of Fanny Ward), hat pins, leather post cards, tobacco cards, boxes with cloth scraps and dried flowers from Ulysses S. Grant's funeral (which were mementos belonging to Cornell's grandparents), a papier-mache pull-toy horse, a shell box, sheet music, plastic dolls, match boxes, stuffed bird figures, metal pendants, clockhands, wood and cork pieces, beads, and other material.  Most, if not all, of this material was accumulated by Cornell in the course of his regular collecting activities.  Some of the objects are of uncertain origin and may have belonged to his brother, Robert.</p>   
<p>Cornell seems to have used some of these items, including the tobacco cards, sheet music, hat pins, leather post cards, cartes-de-visite, autograph book, and miniature rug samples, in a layout he designed for <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping</emph> magazine.  Other items, including the shell box, papier-mache pull-toy horse, and memento boxes from General Grant's funeral, seem to have been part of the 1982 exhibition, "Joseph Cornell: An Exploration of Sources," at the National Museum of American Art, which presented a select group of boxes and collages in the context of his source materials.  (<emph render="italic">See</emph> Series 10 for a letter from the Acting Director of NMAA identifying these materials.)</p>  
<p>Other items in this series, such as the wood and cork pieces, the clockhands, and wooden beads, could also constitute some of the found objects that Cornell collected and often used in many of his box constructions.  Items, such as dried flowers from Lawrence farm and even the memento boxes of Grant's funeral, could constitute those objects that Cornell often collected as souvenirs and memorabilia relating to a particular event or idea.  The dried flowers, for instance, seem to relate to the <emph render="italic">GC 44</emph> "exploration," of which Cornell's visits to Lawrence farm played a part.</p>
</scopecontent>

<arrangement><p>As far as possible, material is arranged in chronological order.  For storage and preservation purposes, loose objects that cannot be housed in folders are housed together within smaller boxes, which are then housed in an archival box.  For descriptive purposes, loose objects are treated as one file with an item list (provided below).</p>

<p>Series consists of artist and art work photographs, family photographs, photographs by and of various individuals, and publicity photographs from the New York City Ballet.  Artist photographs include photocopies of ones of Cornell and ones of the sculptor, Lee Bontecou, taken by Hans Namuth.  Namuth's photographs of Cornell, including some of the photocopied ones found here, were featured in the book, <emph render="italic">American Masters: The Voice and the Myth</emph> by Brian O'Doherty.  Art work photographs include a photograph of one of Cornell's commercial projects (Still Life for <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping</emph>), and stats of Robert Cornell's drawings, some of which Cornell may have used in the series of memorial collages he created after Robert's death.  Family photographs include childhood images of Cornell with various members of his family, an image of Cornell as a student, a childhood image of Robert Cornell and photographs of Robert as an adult and his train collection, photographs of Cornell's mother later in life, and what seem to be various photographs of nieces and nephews.  Also found are photographs taken by friends and acquaintances of Cornell, including Wayne Andrews, David Gahr, Harry Roseman, and Terry Schutte, as well as photographs of various friends, including Marcel Duchamp, Tilly Losch, and Mina Loy.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Series consists of several books, and various publications and clippings collected by Cornell apart from that which he accumulated as source material.</p> 
<p>The books found here most likely comprise the remainder of Cornell's library, which was transferred to the Joseph Cornell Study Center, Smithsonian American Art Museum.  They reflect some of Cornell's wide-ranging interests, including Christian Science, astronomy, and literature.  Notable ones include a copy of <emph render="italic">Nevertheless</emph>, inscribed to Cornell and signed by the author, Marianne Moore; a copy of <emph render="italic">New Testament - Psalms</emph>, which appears to have been a gift to Cornell from his mother; and a copy of <emph render="italic">Sylvie - Recollections of Valois</emph> by the French author, Gerard de Nerval, whose writing had a tremendous influence on Cornell.  Some of the books actually seem to have belonged to Cornell's sister, Betty Cornell Benton, including one of the copies of <emph render="italic">Christian Science and Its Discoverer</emph>, and Christina Rossetti's <emph render="italic">Poems</emph>, which appears to have been a gift from Cornell.</p>  
<p>Printed material includes booklets and publications that likewise reflect Cornell's interest in Christian Science, as well as his interest in art and ballet.  Found are magazines with articles on other artists and a copy of Allison Delarue's privately-printed monograph on Henry Wikoff, the impressario who brought the Austrian dancer, Fanny Elssler, to America in the 1840s.  Printed material also includes clippings and press releases relating to exhibitions of Cornell's art work at New York University (1963) and the Guggenheim Museum (1967), as well as a copy of the December 1957 issue of <emph render="italic">Art News</emph>, which featured an article on Cornell and which includes his annotations indicating his negative reaction to how he was portrayed.</p>

<p>Series consists of writings about Cornell's art work.  Included is an article by the poet, Mina Loy (who was a friend and admirer), which represents a writing by one of Cornell's contemporaries.  It is not clear where, or even whether, this article was published.  The copy found here is a typescript which Loy appears to have shared with Cornell, containing revisions (perhaps by Cornell) in pencil. Other writings include copies of various theses, presentations, and articles stemming from research on Cornell conducted by several graduate students in art history.  These individuals were in contact with Betty Cornell Benton in the process of doing their research (<emph render="italic">See</emph> Series 10 for their correspondence), and they ended up sending her copies of the final products.  These graduate student writings represent some early examples of Cornell scholarship in the field of art history.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Series is comprised primarily of correspondence, legal documents, and printed material created and accumulated by Betty Cornell Benton in her role as residuary legatee of Cornell's estate, as well as some miscellaneous family papers.  Estate papers relate to Benton's administration of the part of Cornell's estate for which she was responsible and her various legal disputes with the executors of the estate.  They shed light, to a certain extent, on the exhibition and sale of Cornell art works, as well as on the disposition of Cornell material, during the period of time after his death and up until the mid-1980s.  Estate papers document Benton's efforts to safeguard the memory of Cornell and to foster the memory of their brother, Robert, who was often wrongly portrayed as being mentally disabled; to carry on Cornell's legacy by contributing to charitable institutions and donating art works to museums and universities; and to organize and appropriately dispose of Cornell's papers, books, records, and source material.  They also document the relationships Benton forged with some of Cornell's friends and acquaintances, as well as with curators, museum directors, collectors, dealers, and artists.</p> 
</scopecontent>

<arrangement><p>The Joseph Cornell Estate Papers series is arranged as four subseries:</p> 
<p>
<list> 
<item>10.1: Correspondence, 1954-1986</item> 
<item>10.2: Legal Files, 1966-1968, 1973-1983</item>
<item>10.3: Printed Material, 1944-1982</item>
<item>10.4: Miscellaneous Family Papers, circa 1911, 1944-1964</item>
</list> 
</p>
<p>The bulk of this series has been scanned with the exception of printed materials such as books, magazines and exhibition catalogs for artists other than Cornell; typically only covers, title pages, and/or relevant pages of these items have been digitized.</p>
</arrangement>

<c02 level="subseries"><did><unitid>10.1: </unitid>
<unittitle>Correspondence,<unitdate> 1954-1986</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries consists of correspondence sent and received by Benton in the administration of Cornell's residual estate, as well as some printed material and photographs that were accumulated in the same files.  Correspondents include: lawyers, collectors, dealers, galleries, museums, curators, scholars, writers, art critics, artists, admirers of Cornell, the executors of Cornell's estate, and charitable institutions, as well as some of Cornell's former "helpers," friends, and acquaintances.</p> 
<p>Correspondence generally relates to the exhibition, loan, appraisal, auction, and sale of Cornell art work.  It documents, in particular, Cornell exhibitions at the ACA Galleries, Art Institute of Chicago, Castelli Feigen Corcoran Gallery, Hopper House, Washburn Gallery, and Washington University in St. Louis; and the major Cornell retrospectives, "Joseph Cornell" at the Museum of Modern Art (November 1980-January 1981) and "Joseph Cornell: An Exploration of Sources" at the National Museum of American Art (November 19, 1982-February 27, 1983).  Correspondence also relates to the disposition of Cornell material and art work, including donations of his papers, books, records, and/or source material to various cultural institutions (such as the Anthology Film Archives, Museum of Modern Art, Archives of American Art, and National Museum of American Art, among others), and gifts of art work to various museums and galleries (such as Meadow Brook Art Gallery at Oakland University, Mead Art Gallery at Amherst College, and Williams College Museum of Art, among others).  Correspondence also concerns Benton's gifts of art work (particularly, collages and book objects), source material, memorabilia, and copies of some of Cornell's papers to various individuals.</p> 
<p>Correspondence documents Benton's many efforts to continue Cornell's legacy and to preserve his memory, including her monetary donations to charitable institutions in memory of her brothers; her attempts to correct misinformation and misrepresentations of Cornell and his family published in various articles (as in a letter to <emph render="italic">New York Magazine</emph> correcting a mistake about the nature of Robert's handicap in an article written by Thomas Hess); and her concern to have the right person do a "Cornell book" (as reflected in correspondence with Wayne Andrews, Dore Ashton, Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, Diane Waldman, and Don Windham).  Correspondence also documents her role in facilitating research on Cornell, including that of graduate students, such as Sherry Friend and Helen Haroutanian (<emph render="italic">See also</emph> Series 9), and that of scholars such as David Porter; her work organizing and cataloging Cornell's papers and source material; and the various requests she fielded for information about or authentication of certain Cornell works.</p> 
</scopecontent>
<arrangement><p>Benton organized the correspondence into files according to correspondent, and the files in alphabetical order according to name of institution or surname of individual.  Items in each file were typically accumulated in reverse chronological order.  When only a few items were associated with a correspondent, Benton organized these into general alphabetical files.  The existing organization has, for the most part, been maintained.</p></arrangement>

<unittitle>Legal Files,<unitdate> 1966-1968, 1973-1983</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries is comprised of Benton's files pertaining to various legal matters that arose in the course of administering Cornell's residual estate.  Files primarily consist of copies of correspondence sent and received by Benton's lawyer, Dennis Hurley (of the firm, Behringer, Hurley and Hurley), on her behalf; copies of legal documents such as briefs, exhibits, court reporter's minutes, petitions, affidavits, and compromise agreements; and copies of income tax returns.</p>
<p>Files primarily relate to the legal dispute between the executors of Cornell's estate (Richard Ader and Wayne Andrews) and members of Cornell's family (namely, Benton and her niece, Helen Batcheller).  The main issue of dispute was the ownership of Cornell art works in the possession of family members.  Also at issue was the ownership of the non-Cornell art works owned by Cornell, as well as whether or not certain Cornell material (such as source material and ephemera) was to be considered art work (since art works went to the Trust and remaining material went to Benton as part of the residual estate).  Files also relate to the case in United States Tax Court, determining whether the value of the works transferred to Benton and Batcheller were includable within the gross estate of Cornell for federal estate tax purposes.</p> 
<p>To a lesser extent, files (especially correspondence) also relate to the estate tax proceedings of the Helen S. Cornell estate (<emph render="italic">See also</emph> Series 1); the issue of ownership of the Bebe Marie doll (which initially belonged to Cornell's cousin, Ethel Storms, and was subsequently used by Cornell in the box, <emph render="italic">Untitled (Bebe Marie)</emph>, in the 1940s); the charitable trust, the C and B (Cornell and Benton) Foundation, that Benton established as part of the compromise agreement with the executors; payment of gift taxes on works owned by Batcheller; and the appraisal, insurance and loan of Cornell works owned by Benton.</p> 
</scopecontent>
<arrangement><p>Files are arranged, more or less, chronologically.  Material in the files is arranged in rough reverse chronological order as that seems to have been how Benton typically compiled it.</p> </arrangement>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries is comprised of printed material, some of which was most likely collected by Cornell and either shared with his sister during his lifetime or bequeathed to her along with the rest of his papers, and some of which was created and/or accumulated by Benton during the time she was administering Cornell's residual estate.</p>
<p>Printed material collected by Cornell includes various clippings, a legal publication, issues of <emph render="italic">National Geographic</emph> magazine (with pages cut out), and stamps.  It is possible that some of this printed material (particularly the magazines) constitutes part of Cornell's source material, which he may have used in his own box constructions and collages or shared with Benton for her to use in her collages.  </p>
<p>Printed material collected by Benton includes announcements and catalogs for exhibitions of Cornell works; clippings on or related to Cornell; publications (such as <emph render="italic">Architectural Digest</emph> and <emph render="italic">Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago</emph>) with articles on or referencing Cornell or his art works; lists (created by Benton) of Cornell material given to the Anthology Film Archives and of Cornell's record collection (parts of which seem to have been given to different institutions, including the Lighthouse Music School, the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind, and Southampton College, among others); and a brief biography of Robert Cornell written by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan for the International Year of Disabled Persons at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Subseries consists of fragments of the papers of Betty Cornell Benton and Helen S. Cornell.</p>
<p>Betty Cornell Benton's papers include kindergarten art work, a printed inventory of Robert Cornell's train collection (which she compiled in collaboration with Robert during the time period from 1962 to 1963), and notes.  Some of Benton's notes concern Cornell's biography and magazine collection, and may relate to certain activities in handling his estate. </p> 
<p>Helen S. Cornell's papers include printed material on Flushing and the World's Fair (which took place in Flushing in 1939), as well as some writings.  The printed material, collected and oftentimes annotated by Mrs. Cornell, documents some of the interests she shared with her son and relates to certain formative experiences shared by the family (such as their repeated visits to the World's Fair, which seems to have been a special time for all).</p> 
<p>Beyond the fact that they were stored together, it is unclear how the rest of these fragments relate to Cornell's estate papers.  Related papers can be found amongst biographical material, family correspondence, and Robert Cornell's papers.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Series consists of the personal papers of Cornell's younger brother, Robert, nicknamed Snicky.  Even though he suffered from cerebral palsy and was confined to a wheelchair for most of his life, Robert led an active and creative life, pursuing hobbies such as drawing, train collecting, and short wave radio, and sharing many of Cornell's interests such as music, films, and Christian Science.  Stemming from his creative activities and interests, and his close relationships with family members, his papers include correspondence received by him (<emph render="italic">See</emph> Series 2 for correspondence written by him), writings, art works, printed material, photographs, notes, QSL cards (which are traded amongst amateur radio operators), financial material such as his financial diary and receipts, address book, and his last will and testament.  </p>
<p>It is possible that either Cornell kept Robert's papers amongst his own or that Benton placed Robert's papers in with Cornell's in the course of preparing them for donation.  However Robert's papers came to be included amongst Cornell's, it most likely is not an accident.  Both Cornell and Benton were concerned with how Robert would be remembered.  This concern is reflected in Cornell's use of Robert's drawings in his series of memorial collages and in Benton's expressed tendency to include one of Robert's drawings (usually a copy) when loaning or donating Cornell art works (<emph render="italic">See</emph> copy of letters to Aline Porter in Subseries 10.1).  The fact that Robert's papers can be found amongst Cornell's can be interpreted as part of the family's effort to foster Robert's memory.</p>

<arrangement><p>The Robert Cornell Papers are arranged alphabetically according to format. The bulk of this series has been scanned; typically only covers, title pages, and/or relevant pages of printed material such as magazines and exhibition catalogs for artists other than Cornell, have been scanned.</p></arrangement>
