            <p>The collection was processed to a minimum level with a finding aid prepared by Catherine S. Gaines in 2013. The Archives of American Art has implemented minimal processing tactics when possible in order to increase information about and access to more of our collections. Minimal processing included arrangement to the series and folder level. Generally, items within folders were simply verified with folder titles, but not arranged further. Folders within boxes were not numbered. The collection was rehoused in archival containers and folders, but not all staples and clips were removed.</p>

Baur, Harry Bertoia, Flora Biddle, Norman Bluhm, James Brooks, Fritz Bultman, Leo Castelli, William N.

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Bernard Harper Friedman (1926-2011), a writer best known as the author of the first biography of Jackson Pollock, was also an art critic and art collector involved in the cultural life of New York City.</p>
            <p>Bernard Harper Friedman, known professionally as B. H. Friedman, was called Bob by family and friends. After interrupting his studies at Cornell University to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he graduated in 1948 with a degree in English. Friedman and his new bride, fellow student Abby G. Noselson (1926-2003), returned home to New York City and he began a real estate career in his uncles' firm, Uris Buildings Corporation. While a businessman, Friedman spent much of his spare time writing. He produced fiction, plays, and criticism; Friedman's articles on art, literature and music appeared in a wide variety of periodicals. During this period, Friedman also pursued his interests in jazz, collecting abstract art, and psychedelic drug experiences with Timothy Leary.</p>
            <p>His first published novel, 
                <emph render="italic">Circles</emph>, about the Abstract Expressionist milieu, appeared in 1962. A year later, B. H. Friedman became a full-time writer. For nearly 20 years, he divided his time between New York City and Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he was affiliated with the Fine Arts Work Center as a director and consultant. During this period, he published several novels and two biographies: 
                <emph render="italic">Jackson Pollock: Energy Made Visible </emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney</emph>, written with Flora Biddle. More novels and short story collections were published, and staged readings of seven plays were presented between 1987 and 2007. 
                <emph render="italic">Tripping</emph>, a memoir of using psychedlics with Timothy Leary, appeared in 2006.</p>
            <p>A founding member of Fiction Collective, a nonprofit publishing group run by and for writers, Friedman was also a member of several national writers' organizations. He served as a trustee of the Whitney Musuem of American Art, 1961-1968, and then as honorary trustee. B. H. Friedman died from complications of pneumonia on January 4, 2011 in New York City.</p>

                    <p>Friedman's correspondence is both professional and personal in nature, occasionally combining both spheres. Many letters are addressed to Bob (as Friedman was known to family and friends). Some are addressed to the couple and a few are to Abby.</p>

                    <p>This series is alphabetized by correspondent. Filing is inconsistent - some letters may be found under the correspondent's name while other portions of the exchanged are filed by business name. Folders for individual correspondents contain five or more letters. Correspondence with individuals or organizations represented by fewer than five letters is grouped alphabetically in folders titled "miscellaneous." Additional correspondence is found among the subject files (Series 6).</p>

                    <p>Writings by B. H. Friedman include novels, plays, short stories, poems, articles, monographs, and criticism. Over time, many pieces were reworked. Sometimes titles changed or were reused; occasionally, prose became a play or short stories were greatly expanded. Among the published versions of Friedman's writings are two books and some short stories with no corresponding manuscript material. This series also includes recordings (3 videocassettes (VHS), 2 sound cassettes, and 1 sound reel) of lectures by Friedman and panel discussions in which he participated. Writings by other authors include the text of a lecture presented by John Cage at Cal Tech.</p>
