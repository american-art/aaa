<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Louis Wiesenberg (1893-1943) was born in Poland and studied art in Montreal and at the National Academy of Design in New York.  He settled in New York where he painted and drew.  He later moved back to Montreal, but continued to exhibit in New York. </p>

<p>In 1909, Wiesenberg immigrated to Montreal, Canada, with his father and two sisters, leaving his mother and three other sisters in Poland until money could be sent for their passage.  His father, who had studied painting in Paris, established a small paint shop in which Louis learned about paint, brushes, and other artistic tools.</p>

<p>After studying art at the Monument Nationale School in Montreal, Louis Wiesenberg continued his studies at the National Academy of Design in New York City in 1916. Following the death of his eldest sister in 1917, Wiesenberg returned to Montreal to assist in his father??s business, but continued to exhibit his artwork in Montreal, Ottawa, and New York.</p>

<p>In 1922 Wiesenberg married Raizel, a singer, and they eventually settled in New York City.  They befriended many artists, including Milton Avery and Mark Rothko.  In 1928, a series of portrait drawings of authors by Wiesenberg was published in the <emph render="italic">Herald Tribune</emph>.  He also worked at various art-related jobs including teaching art at a children??s camp in order to make ends meet.  During the Depression, Wiesenberg??s health began to fail.</p>

<p>Louis Wiesenberg died on December 22, 1943 in New York City.</p>
