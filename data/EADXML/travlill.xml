            <p>Lillian E. Travis (1886-1961) lived in New York. Prior to 1900, she married John C. Travis and had two daughters, Marion (1900-1985) and Viola (1905-1982). She divorced in 1907 and moved to New York. Travis enrolled at the Art Students League, where she became acquainted with Edith Dimock Glackens. Lillian and her daughters formed close ties to the Glackens family and their circle of friends, which included Maurice Prendergast, Charles Prendergast and his wife, Eugenie. Struck by Lillian's rich golden hair, William Glackens had her serve as his model for his painting, 
                <emph render="italic">The Shoppers</emph>. Marion Travis and Viola Travis Crawford were also close friends of William Glackens's son, Ira and his wife, Nancy. Lillian E. Travis died in New York in 1961.</p>
            <p>American realist painter, William Glackens (1870-1938) lived and worked in New York City and Westport, Connecticut. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts under Robert Henri. Glackens began his career as a commercial illustrator for newspapers and periodicals. He later turned to painting and was part of "The Eight," a group of artists dedicated to portraying realistic scenes of daily urban life.</p>
            <p>Painter, sculptor, and artisan frame-maker, Charles Prendergast (1863-1948) lived and worked with his brother, Maurice (1858-1924) in Boston, Massachusetts before moving to New York City in 1914. Charles achieved prominence as a craftsman and framemaker, and later specialized in painted, gilded, and incised panels of exotic and folk subjects.</p>

            <p>The collection was processed to a minimal level and a finding aid prepared in 2013 by Joy Goodwin. The Archives of American Art has implemented minimal processing tactics when possible in order to increase information about and access to more of our collections. Minimal processing included arrangement to the series and folder levels. Generally, items within folders were simply verified with folder titles, but not arranged further. Folders within boxes were not numbered. The collection was rehoused in archival containers and folders, but not all staples and clips were removed.</p>
