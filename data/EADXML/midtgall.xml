<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Alan D. Gruskin (1904-1970) hoped to become an artist, but while still a student realized that his talents were better suited to art administration than painting. Following graduation from Harvard University, he worked at a New York gallery that specialized in old masters, returning home to Pennsylvania after a year to pursue a writing career that ultimately proved unsuccessful. Gruskin returned to New York and opened Midtown Galleries at 559 Fifth Avenue in 1932. Specializing in work by living American artists, Midtown was one of a rather small number of commercial galleries in New York City that showed contemporary American art. Midtown Galleries represented academic and realist painters, and purposely avoided abstract art.</p>
<p>Founded during the Depression, Midtown Galleries was a shoe-string operation in its early years. Originally operated as a cooperative, Midtown Galleries' participating artists contributed to the costs and work of presenting exhibitions. Between 1932 and 1935, Gruskin served as "Art Director" of the gallery and his business partner, Francis C. Healey was "Publicity Director." Healey appears to have been responsible for weekly broadcasts on NBC radio designed to interest people in visiting the gallery. The 15-minute programs consisted of discussions with museum directors, curators, artists, writers, and musicians about a broad range of cultural topics. Copies of the scripts were offered for a dime, and the payments mailed by radio listeners bought Gruskin's meals. During this period, Gruskin lived in the gallery. After Healey's departure in 1935, Midtown Galleries ceased to be run as a cooperative.</p>
<p>Midtown Galleries usually represented approximately two dozen artists, and many remained with the gallery for decades. They included: Julien Binford, Isabel Bishop, Paul Cadmus, Gladys Rockmore Davis, Emlen Etting, Maurice Freedman, Dong Kingman, Oronzio Maldarelli, William C. Palmer, Waldo Peirce, Doris Rosenthal, Zoltan L. Sepeshy, Frederic Taubes, William Thon, Margit Varga, and Robert Vickrey.</p>
<p>Gruskin worked to educate and interest the public in American art and to promote the artists he represented. In addition to countless reviews, articles, and catalog essays, he wrote three books: <emph render="italic">Painting in the U.S.A. </emph>(1946), <emph render="italic">The Watercolors of Dong Kingman and How the Artist Works </emph>(1958), <emph render="italic">William Thon: The Artist and His Technique </emph>(1964). Gruskin advocated the use of fine art in advertising and industry, obtaining commissions for his artists and at the same time assisting clients in building corporate collections. A prime example is the Upjohn Company which, at Gruskin's urging, included reproductions of paintings in "Your Doctor Speaks," a series of public service announcements. Many of the paintings were purchased subsequently, forming the basis of the Upjohn Collection. A traveling exhibition, <emph render="italic">The Upjohn Company Collection of Contemporary American Paintings</emph>, was circulated by Midtown Galleries and featured in a <emph render="italic">Life </emph>magazine article about fine art and advertising. Another example is the fabric patterns, based on paintings by several of Midtown Galleries' artists, commissioned by the Onandoga Silk Company; the fabrics were used for dresses by popular designers, with fashion shows and window displays of paintings by the participating artists at selected department stores throughout the country.
Working closely with architects and interior designers, Gruskin and Midtown Galleries were innovators in the use of domestic and business settings to showcase art with <emph render="italic">Art In Interiors</emph>, a series of exhibitions held annually between 1952 and 1961.</p>
<p>Midtown Galleries was a pioneer in circulating traveling exhibitions to colleges and art associations in communities distant from major art museums and commercial galleries. Beginning in 1936 and or more than 35 years, Midtown Galleries circulated 8-10 shows throughout the country each year; most were group shows organized around a theme, though occasional solo exhibitions were offered. Other important exhibitions off the premises were the Central Illinois Art Exposition, 1939, and the contemporary American art exhibition at the New York World's Fair, 1964-1965. The 1939 show organized by Gruskin for the Bloomington, Illinois, Art Association was a large exhibition of American art borrowed from a variety of institutions; the very well-publicized show was heavily attended, drawing visitors from a large area of the rural Midwest, many of whom had never visited a museum or seen original art.</p>

<head>Provenance</head>
<p>Midtown Galleries loaned a small number of records consisting of news releases, 1939-1966, and exhibition schedules to the Archives of American Art for microfilming in 1966. Subsequently, Mary J. Gruskin donated this material, along with many other gallery records, to the Archives in several installments between 1972 and 1991; an additional gift was received in 1997. The portion loaned in 1966 is now integrated with the main records and has been refilmed in sequence. Unfortunately, the addition of 1997 was received in Washington, D.C. after microfilming was well underway. The addition has been microfilmed and described separately as Series 10.

<scopecontent> 
<p>Inventories (2 linear feet) of Midtown Galleries stock, 1946-1980, and undated, indicate artist, title, date, medium, dimensions, and whether a piece is framed or unframed. Often, a bin number or other location is specified, and occasionally insurance values are included. Most inventories are arranged alphabetically by artist, but some are arranged by storage location; some are in the form of lists and others are card files. Other records relating to gallery stock are included in this series. These include lists of paintings on consignment and lists of paintings returned to artists, as well as loan/shipping logs, and "traffic cards."</p>
<p>Sales records (3.3 linear feet) include "group totals," artists account ledgers, and copies of sales slips arranged by name of artist.</p>

<p>Financial records consist of invoices for bills paid (arranged alphabetically by name of creditor); banking records such as statements and passbooks; accounting records including an accounts receivable ledger and a petty cash book; and federal, state, and city income and business tax records. Because these are likely to be of interest to a very limited number of researchers, this series was not microfilmed; of course, arrangements may be made for the original records to be consulted at our Washington office. Financial information concerning gallery stock is included in Series 3: Inventory and Sales Records, and letters relating to gallery purchases and sales may also be included with Series 1: Administrative Correspondence.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous records include Midtown Galleries guest registers complete at 32 volumes except for the first two years of the galleries's existence. This series includes artifacts, mainly samples of artist-designed or inspired silk fabrics produced for the Onandoga Silk Co.; several department stores featured garments made from the fabrics and mounted small exhibitions of the paintings on which the fabrics were based. Also, two brass labels from paintings and a sound recording with a cover designed by a Midtown Galleries artist. Writings by authors other than Alan D. Gruskin are manuscripts about Isabel Bishop and Philip Guston (Gruskin's writings are part of Series 8: Personal Papers of Alan D. and Mary J. Gruskin). Legal documents include items such as the galleries' Act of Incorporation, partnership agreements, and leases.</p>

<head>Index: Midtown Galleries Exhibitions, 1932-1995, undated</head>
<p>This list was compiled from announcements and catalogs produced by Midtown Galleries. A few of these were not included with the Midtown Galleries records, but were microfilmed in the mid-1960s as part of an Archives of American Art project to microfilm exhibition catalogs at a number of art libraries. Microfilm reel and frame numbers for these items are indicated in parentheses (reel: frames) immediately following the title. Most are part of Series VII: Printed Matter, and are microfilmed in chronological order; those marked with an asterisk (*) are part of the 1997 addition (5438: 713-838 and 889-932).</p>
