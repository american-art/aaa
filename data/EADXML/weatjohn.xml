<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>American writer John Weatherwax (1900-1984) was born in Aberdeen, Washington, and attended the University of Washington in Seattle for two years before going to Harvard College in 1921. His studies focused on English literature, business, mythology, and world literature. Weatherwax wrote a number of children's stories and, in 1934, co-authored with his sister and brother-in-law Gerald Strang, <emph render="italic">The Coming of the Animals</emph>, a series of California Native American stories.</p>

<p>Weatherwax met Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and painter Frida Kahlo in San Francisco when the couple stayed with sculptor Ralph Stackpole in his studio on Montgomery Street.  Rivera was there to work on a commission to paint a mural for the San Francisco Stock Exchange.  At the time Weatherwax was working on an English translation of the ancient Mayan codex, <emph render="italic">Popol Vuh</emph>, and asked Rivera if he would provide illustrations for the manuscript. Although the translation was never published, Rivera agreed and produced twenty-four watercolor illustrations for the text.</p> 

<p>Weatherwax revealed his admiration for Diego and Frida by writing a manuscript entitled "The Queen of Montgomery Street" , a clever short story about Frida's and Diego's experiences in San Francisco.  Probably written as a gift to the Rivera's, the central figures of "The Queen of Montgomery Street" where Diego as King and Frida as Queen.  He also wrote a story entitled "Diego".
