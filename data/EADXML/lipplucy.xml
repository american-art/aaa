            <p>New York writer, curator, art critic, and teacher, Lucy R. Lippard (1937-) is the curator of numerous exhibitions and the author of 20 books and other writings that trace the emergence of minimalist, post-minimalist, and conceptual art and document Lippard's committment to feminism and political activism.</p>
            <p>Born in New York City in 1937, Lippard earned a B.A. from Smith college in 1958 and a M.A. in 1962 from New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. In the 1960s she began writing art criticism for the journals 
                <emph render="italic">Art International</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Artforum</emph>. In 1966 she curated the landmark "Eccentric Abstraction" exhibition at the Fischbach Gallery in New York City which established the standard for what would be considered post-minimalist art. Lippard then curated the first of four defining conceptual art exhibitions that became known as her "numbers shows," each titled after the populations of the cities in which they took place, with catalogs in the form of a set of 10 x 15 cm index cards. Opening at the Seattle Art Museum in 1969, "557,087" was followed by "955,000" in Vancouver, Canada, a few months later. "2,972,453" was held at the Centro de Arte y Comunicacíon in Buenos Aires in 1971 and "c.7500" opened in Valencia, California, in 1973-1974 before traveling to several other venues in the United States and Europe.</p>
            <p>Lippard's first book, 
                <emph render="italic">The Graphic Work of Philip Evergood</emph> was published in 1966, followed by 
                <emph render="italic">Pop Art</emph> the same year. 
                <emph render="italic"> Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object</emph> (1973) and 
                <emph render="italic">From the Center: Feminist Essays on Women's Art</emph> (1976) documented the emergence of conceptual art and the early years of feminist art respectively. In 1976 Lippard published her seminal book on the life and work of Eva Hesse.</p>
            <p>Between 1977 and 1978 Lippard lived on a farm in Devon, England, intending to write a novel. During her walks across the English countryside she became interested in landscape art and conceived of her book 
                <emph render="italic">Overlay: Contemporary Art and the Art of Prehistory</emph> which was subsequently published in 1983. Other books include 
                <emph render="italic">Get the Message?: A Decade Of Art For Social Change</emph> (1984), 
                <emph render="italic">Ad Reinhardt</emph> (1985), and 
                <emph render="italic">Mixed Blessings: New Art in a Multicultural America</emph> (1990). Lippard has also written regular columns on art and politics for the 
                <emph render="italic">Village Voice</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">In These Times</emph> and
                <emph render="italic"> Z Magazine</emph>, and has been a contributing editor of 
                <emph render="italic">Art in America</emph>.</p>
            <p>Lippard was radicalized during a trip to Argentina in 1968 when she was invited to be a juror at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires. On her return to the United States she became heavily involved in anti-war activities and the Art Workers Coalition. She is a co-founder of several feminist and artist organizations including the feminist collective Heresies, which produced 
                <emph render="italic">Heresies: A Feminist Journal on Art and Politics</emph> from 1977-1992, Ad Hoc Women Artists, Alliance for Cultural Democracy, Artists Call Against U.S. Intervention in Central America, Artists Meeting for Cultural Change, Women's Action Coalition, and Women's Art Registry. In 1976 she was a founder of Printed Matter, a New York nonprofit dedicated to producing publications by artists. She also worked closely with Franklin Furnace, an artist-run space devoted to the promotion of artists' books, installation art, and video and performance art, and served on the organization's International Committee.</p>
            <p>Lippard has been a visiting professor at the School of Visual Arts, the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the University of Queensland, Australia. She has received honorary doctorates in fine arts from Maine College of Art, the Massachusetts College of Art, Moore College of Art, and San Francisco Art Institute, as well as awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship, two National Endowment for the Arts grants in criticism, the Smith College Medal and the ArtTable Award for Distinguished Service to the Visual Arts.</p>
            <p>Lippard has lived in New Mexico since 1992 and continues to work as a freelance writer and speaker.</p>

Also found are Lippard's notes and writings including sound recordings and interviews, teaching and exhibition files, printed material, several works of art, and photographs of artwork and artists. Scattered throughout the collection are a small number of records concerning Lippard's personal life.</p>
            <p>A small amount of biographical material comprises resumes and an address book.</p>
            <p>Correspondence files document all aspects of Lippard's professional life including her relatiohnships with artists such as Carl Andre, Judy Chicago, Hanne Darboven, Ray Johnson, Sol LeWitt, and Henry Pearson; feminist artists including Mary Beth Edelson, Harmony Hammond, Donna Henes, and May Stevens; political and art-related activist groups such as Alliance for Cultural Democracy, Art Workers Coalition, Political Art Documentation/Distrubution, Printed Matter, and Women's Caucus for Art; galleries and museums including Addison Gallery of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, and publishers including 
                <emph render="italic">Art International</emph> and

The series also traces the development of Lippard's involvement in activist causes including censorship and the rights of artists, Central America and the impact of U.S. policy on the region, and equality and reproductive rights for women, as well as her interest in conceptual, minimalist and post-minimalist art. The series includes scattered artwork and photographs of artists.</p>
            <p>Writings are primarily by Lippard and include correspondence, manuscript drafts, extensive notes, and publication records for some of her best-known books such as

            <p>Printed material includes a collection of articles written by Lippard and a small amount of material concerning events, such as speaking engagements, in which Lippard was involved.

                    <p>Correspondence forms the bulk of the collection and is between Lippard and artists, writers, galleries, art institutions and organizations, educational institutions, political organizations, and publishers. Also found is a small amount of personal and family correspondence. The bulk of the correspondence is incoming with scattered copies of Lippard's outgoing replies.</p>
                    <p>In addition to correspondence and notes, the series includes a significant amount of printed matter, such as clippings, journals, exhibition catalogs and announcements, and scattered publications of the Mail Art network, photographic material including photographs of artwork and artists, and original artwork found in some of the artist's files.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes recordings on 7 sound tape reels and 18 sound cassettes.</p>

                    <p>Lippard appears to have sorted incoming mail into very rough alphabetical order prior to donation, generally mixing correspondence with files that could more accurately be described as subject or reference files. Although the latter primarily consist of photographic and/or printed material, the basic alphabetical arrangement of the creator has been maintained and sorted into 2 subseries. All correspondents and subjects with 4 or more related items are housed in a named file; all other items are housed in a "General" file at the end of the file group for the appropriate letter of the alphabet.</p>

                        <p>The series documents all aspects of Lippards professional life, primarily from the 1960s on, including her relationship with artists such as Carl Andre, Iain Baxter (N. E. Thing Co.), Bruce Barber, Carole Berge, Steve Cagan, Don Celender, Judy Chicago, Hanne Darboven, Ken Friedman, Donna Henes, Hera, Alexis Hunter, Ray Johnson, Joseph Kossuth, Sol LeWitt, Martha Rosler, Henry Pearson, Arthur and Irene Siegel, Tal Streeter, Bill Vazan and many more. Lippard's interest in and committment to the emerging feminist art scene can be traced in correspondence with artists such as Joan Braderman, Mary Beth Edelson, Harmony Hammond, Ruth Hardinger, Elizabeth Hess, Miriam Schapiro, May Stevens and Merle Temkin, many of whom, along with Lippard, were founding members of the New York-based Heresies Collective.</p>
                        <p>Also found here is correspondence and other material documenting Lippard's involvement with art galleries, art instutions and activist groups including Addison Gallery of American Art, Alliance for Cultural Democracy, and Political Art Documentation/Distribution (PAD/D). PAD/D material consists of 11 audio recordings from circa 1984 related to "Artists Call Against U.S. Intervention in Central America" and other activities of the group. Eight folders document the founding and early years of the Women's Caucus for Art from the early 1970s to 1981 and the series includes Lippard's correspondence with related individuals and organizations such as Arlene Raven, Sheila de Bretteville and the College Art Association. Records on the Art Workers Coalition (AWC) and the Museum of Modern Art document Lippard's involvement in the AWC's artists' rights protests aimed at pressurizing the Museum of Modern Art and other museums to implement certain reforms, including a weekly free admission day.</p>
                        <p>Correspondence with Ray Johnson includes original letters from Johnson to Lippard and many examples of his mail art. A folder of letters from Christo and Jean-Claude includes a letter illustrated with sketches of artwork that had impressed Christo at a University of British Columbia art show and describing a meeting with Ray Johnson. Six folders of correspondence from Hanne Darboven are interspersed with her distinctive colors, dashes, numbers and wavy lines and letters and postcards from Sol LeWitt include sketches and descriptions of artwork.</p>
                        <p>Lippard corresponded with many artists outside the United States, including Australian artists Vivienne Binns and Peter Kennedy, and New Zealand artist Bruce Barber, and wrote an article for 
                            <emph render="italic">Arts Canada</emph> on the Canadian group Pulsa. Her interest in landscape art can be traced in her correspondence with artists such as Bill Vazan and British artist Richard Long.</p>
                        <p>There are 4 folders of correspondence between Lippard and James (Jim) Fitzimmons regarding her work for the publication 
                            <emph render="italic">Art International</emph> during the 1960s, and two folders of correspondence with publisher Harry N. Abrams, Inc., but the bulk of the correspondence related to Lippard's writings can be found in Series 3.1. Other writers with whom Lippard corresponded include New York art critic Frederick Ted Castle, artist and writer Judy Loeb, writer and storyteller Gioia Timpanelli and Argentine-born critic Susana Torre, who designed the cover for Lippard's book 
                            <emph render="italic">From the Center: Feminist Essays on Women's Art</emph> (1976).</p>
                        <p>The series includes one folder each of correspondence from Lippard's parents Margaret Lippard and Vernon W. Lippard.</p>
                        <p>Sound recordings are on 7 sound tape reels and 17 sound cassettes.</p>

                        <p>This series primarily documents Lipppard's engagement with social and political issues and groups working for change through activism and art. While much of the content comprises printed material on issues such as artists rights, censorship, U. S. policy in Central Americal, conceptual art, public art, and reproductive rights, these files are interespersed with correspondence with related individuals including artists, photographic material, and some of Lippard's related notes and writings. For example, folders on conceptual art include a draft manuscript for Lippard's essay 
                            <emph render="italic">Escape Attempts</emph>. Folder headings are generally derived from those used by Lippard.</p>
                        <p>Records on Central America include material relating to the Nicaraguan Cultural Alliance. A group of folders concerning non-U.S. galleries document Lippard's interaction with artists and galleries overseas, including European and Austrialian galleries and the Centro de Arte y Comunicacíon in Buenos Aires where Lippard's third "numbers show" "2,972,453," was held in 1971.</p>
                        <p>Note that the 5 folders on "Jobs" relate specifically to work opportunities offered to Lippard such as speaking engagements and participation on committees, juries and panels.</p>
                        <p>Mail art folders comprise a mixture of printed material including copies of the 
                            <emph render="italic">Balloon Newspaper</emph>, and correspondence from mail art and fluxus artists such as Fletcher Copp and Ken Friedman.</p>
                        <p>Mail art records also include the results of Ray Johnson's mailing, "Send Slips to Lucy Lippard," which Johnson apparently undertook after Lippard omitted him from her book
                            <emph render="italic"> Pop Art </emph> (1966). Following this "slip" she was the recipient of various interpretations of the word including an actual slip to wear.</p>
                        <p>Series includes 1 recording on 1 sound cassette.</p>

                        <p>The series documents Lippard's writing activities, primarily from the 1960s to the 1990s, and provides insight into the content and process of her writing for books, columns, essays, and lectures.</p>
                        <p>Lippard's most renowned writings from this period, including her seminal text on conceptual art, 
                            <emph render="italic">Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object</emph> (1973), her mongraph on Eva Hesse (1976), 
                            <emph render="italic">Get the Message?: A Decade Of Art For Social Change</emph> (1984), and 
                            <emph render="italic">Mixed Blessings: New Art in a Multicultural America</emph> (1990), are represented here. The series also includes Lippard's early "New York Letter" manuscripts written for 
                            <emph render="italic">Art International</emph>, and circa 100 additional essays written for publications such as 
                            <emph render="italic">Artforum</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">Art Voices</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">Hudson Review</emph>, including "The Pink Glass Swan" and "Trojan Horses: Activist Art and Power" (1984), as well as essays written for exhibitions on artists such as Rudy Burckhardt, Sol LeWitt, Ree Morton, and James Rosenquist. Also found are records documenting Lippard's role as co-editor for the Alliance for Cultural Democracy handbook 
                            <emph render="italic">How to '92: Model Actions for a Post-Columbian World</emph>.</p>
                        <p>Correspondence found in this series primarily relates to contracts and other aspects of the publication process, but there is also some correspondence with, and related to, artists including two folders of correspondence from Philip Evergood written to Lippard as she was writing 
                            <emph render="italic">The Graphic Work of Philip Evergood</emph> (1966), a detailed letter from Ethelyn Haig concerning recollections of Eva Hesse, photocopies of Hesse's correspondence and interviews, and some photocopies of correspondence from Ad Reinhardt.</p>
                        <p>The series also includes transcripts, notes and related material, including some audio recordings, of 5 interviews of Lippard and 6 interviews conducted by Lippard. These have been arranged as part of this series because they are annotated and edited by Lippard. They include recordings of interviews of Donald Judd and Robert Mangold in 1965 and 1968, transcripts of Lippard's interviews of Sol LeWitt and Tony Smith, and transcripts of interviews of Lippard conducted by Scott Marsden, and Ursula Meyer. Also found is the transcript of an interview regarding Lippard's 1998 book 
                            <emph render="italic">The Lure of the Local</emph>.</p>
                        <p>From 1970 to 1976 Lippard's speaking engagements at art schools were confined to answering written questions submitted by audiences; this series includes an extensive selection of these "questions addressed to Lippard in art schools." There are files on symposia and conferences which include notes and texts for Lippard's contributions and transcripts and notes of panel discussions edited by Lippard for publication.</p>
                        <p>Additional writings for exhibition catalogs can be found in Series 5.</p>

Note that reel 2 is labeled "Windham Symposium," but as no other reference was found to this term, and both reels are from the same event, this recording has been given the name "Art and technology symposium." Reel 1, side 2 contains apparently unrelated recording, possibly taped off-the-air, of a news program related to the assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

                    <p>Records primarily document Lippard's role as an exhibition curator and organizer with some of her most renowned exhibitions represented here. Of particular note are files concerning her "numbers shows." Files for "557,087" in Seattle, "955,000" in Vancouver, "2,972,453" in Buenos Aires (also titled "Arte Conceptual" in the publicity material from the Centro de Arte y Comunicacíon), and "c. 7500" in Valencia, California, include some of Lippard's questionnaire's completed and returned to her by artists who participated in the exhibitions, specifications for the installation of artwork, checklists, sketches, expense records, floor plans, scattered photographic material (although not of the exhibitions) and printed material. Other files in the series may also contain correspondence and notes, exhibition plans and checklists, research material for catalogs, manuscripts and notes, photographs and publicity material.</p>
                    <p>Many of the files document contributions to catalogs for exhibitions that Lippard did not curate. In addition to correspondence these may include research material such as printed matter, notes, drafts and manuscripts of catalog essays.</p>
                    <p>Files on a few exhibitions with which Lippard seems to have had no personal involvement are included in Series 2.1.</p>

                    <p>Photographs of exhibitions are followed by photos of people, and photos of works of art arranged alphabetically by artist. Although few are dated, the photographs found here were generally produced between the 1950s and 1970s. Folder labels for photographs of works of art reflect the dates of execution.</p>

                    <p>Series consists primarily of photographic prints, with some negatives and slides. Photographs of exhibition installations of various artists and galleries include Tal Streeter at Ame Gallery in 1965, Walter De Maria at Paula Johnson Gallery in 1965, and Andy Warhol exhibitions at Leo Castelli, Stable Gallery and Ferus Gallery.</p>
                    <p>One folder of photographs of artists includes photos of Marcel Duchamp, Lyman Kipp (by Hans Namuth), J. J. Lebel, Sheldon Machlin and Robert Murray. Also found is a photograph of a street scene with a man identified as Red Grooms standing on a rooftop. This photo was possibly enclosed with correspondence to Lippard but the correspondent is not identified on the photograph.</p>
                    <p>A folder of movie stills includes photographic prints of Hollywood actors and actresses from films such as 
                        <emph render="italic">Jane Eyre</emph>, 
                        <emph render="italic">National Velvet</emph>, and 
                        <emph render="italic">Wuthering Heights</emph>. Actors featured include Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Joan Fontaine, Sophia Loren, Laurence Olivier, Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer Tracy with Katherine Hepburn among others. The photographs were pasted on what appear to be scrapbook pages.</p>
                    <p>Additional photographic material can be found throughout the collection, particularly in Series 2.</p>
