            <p>Esther McCoy (1904-1989) is remembered best for her pioneering work as an architectural historian, critic, and proponent of Southern California modern architecture of the early to mid-twentieth century. Although her professional interests ranged from writing fiction to studying the folk architecture and crafts of Mexico, McCoy achieved her most notable success for her numerous articles, books, and exhibitions about Southern California architecture and the architects associated with the modernist movement.</p>
            <p>Born in Arkansas in 1904, Esther McCoy grew up in Kansas and attended various schools in the Midwest. In 1926 she left the University of Michigan to launch a writing career in New York, where she moved in avant-garde literary circles and conducted research for Theodore Dreiser. She began writing fiction in New York and continued to write after moving to Los Angeles in 1932, working on short stories, novels, and screenplays. She published numerous short stories between 1929 and 1962, with works appearing in the 
                <emph render="italic">New Yorker, Harper's Bazaar</emph>, and university quarterlies. Her short story, "The Cape," was reprinted in 
                <emph render="italic">Best Short Stories of 1950</emph>. Many of the novels that she wrote from the mid-1960s through the 1980s were related thematically to architects and architecture.</p>
            <p>During the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, McCoy participated in the politically radical movements of the period and wrote for leftist publications. Her interest in the lowcost housing projects of modern architects was prompted by one of her articles about slums for 
                <emph render="italic">Epic News</emph>. During World War II she entered a training program for engineering draftsmen at Douglas Aircraft and in 1944 was hired as an architectural draftsman for the architect R.M. Schindler. As she became increasingly interested in modern architecture and design, she combined her two major career interests and began to focus her energies on architectural research, writing, and criticism. Her first article on architecture, "Schindler: Space Architect," was published in 1945 in the journal 
                <emph render="italic">Direction</emph>.</p>
            <p>McCoy began writing about architecture in earnest in 1950 as a free-lance contributor to the 
                <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph>. From then until her death in 1989, she wrote prolifically for 
                <emph render="italic">Arts &amp; Architecture</emph> magazine, 
                <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Herald Examiner</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Architectural Record</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">L'Architectura, Zodiac</emph> (Italy), 
                <emph render="italic">Progressive Architecture</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Lotus</emph> (Italy), 
                <emph render="italic">and Architectural Forum</emph>. In addition to her numerous articles, McCoy wrote several books on Southern California modern architecture and architects. Her first major work, 
                <emph render="italic">Five California Architects</emph>, published in 1960, is now recognized as a classic work in modern architectural history. It promoted a serious study of modern architecture in Southern California and introduced to the world several leading California architects and their work: Bernard Maybeck, Irving Gill, Charles and Henry Greene, and R.M. Schindler. That same year, she published another important book focusing on the work of the California architect Richard Neutra. Other books by McCoy include 
                <emph render="italic">Modern California Houses: Case Study Houses </emph>(1962), 
                <emph render="italic">Craig Ellwood</emph> (1968), 
                <emph render="italic">Vienna to Los Angeles: Two Journeys </emph> (1979), and 
                <emph render="italic">The Second Generation </emph> (1984).</p>
            <p>In addition to these books, McCoy organized and wrote catalogs for several significant exhibitions focusing on contemporary architects. Her first was the 
                <emph render="italic">R.M. Schindler Retrospective</emph>, a 1954 exhibition at the Landau Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Her other exhibitions and accompanying catalogs include 
                <emph render="italic">Roots of California Contemporary Architecture</emph>, 1956, Los Angeles Municipal Art Department; 
                <emph render="italic">Felix Candela</emph>, 1957, University of Southern California, Los Angeles; 
                <emph render="italic">Irving Gill</emph>, 1958, Los Angeles County Museum of Art; 
                <emph render="italic">Juan O'Gorman</emph>, 1964, San Fernando Valley State College; and 
                <emph render="italic">Ten Italian Architects</emph>, 1967, Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Moreover, McCoy contributed numerous essays to other exhibition catalogs and publications, lectured at the University of Southern California, participated in preservation projects, organized tours for the Society of Architectural Historians, and contributed to a number of documentary films. Her energy and interests also led her to catalog and transcribe Richard Neutra's papers at the University of California Los Angeles Archives.</p>
            <p>McCoy received national recognition from the American Institute of Architects for her seminal and prolific work in the field of Southern California modern architectural history and criticism. Her interests, however, were not exclusively bound to California. She traveled the world and was interested in both Italian and Mexican architecture as well as the folk art and crafts of Mexico and South America. She made five extended trips to Italy during the 1950s and 1960s, publishing regularly about the architecture there and curating the exhibition 
                <emph render="italic">Ten Italian Architects</emph>. She was a contributing editor to two Italian journals, 
                <emph render="italic">Zodiac</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Lotus</emph>, and was awarded the Star of Order of Solidarity in 1960 by the Republic of Italy for her research and writing.</p>
            <p>Esther McCoy died of emphysema on December 30, 1989, at the age of eighty-five. Her last contribution was an essay for the exhibition catalog 
                <emph render="italic">Blueprints for Modern Living: History and Legacy of the Case Study House</emph>. The show opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles one month before her death.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The papers of Southern California architectural historian, critic, and writer Esther McCoy measure 42.6 linear feet and date from 1876 to 1990 (bulk 1938-1989). The collection documents McCoy's career, as well as her family and personal life through biographical material, extensive correspondence, personal and professional writings, project files, Southern California architects' files, clippings and other printed material, a large collection of photographs and slides, and taped interviews of Southern California modern architects.</p>
            <p>Biographical and family material consists of awards, resumes, identification documents, and other documentation of McCoy's personal life. Included are a transcript of a 1984 interview of McCoy by Makoto Watanabe and material relating to her friend, Theodore Dreiser.</p>
            <p>Correspondence focuses on her personal relationships with family, friends, and lovers, and general correspondence relating primarily to her work as a writer. McCoy's personal correspondence is valuable to researchers who are interested in her personal life, her struggles as a young writer, and the way in which her family, friends, lovers, mentors, and colleagues helped to shape her work and career. As documented in this correspondence, her life offers a glimpse into twentieth-century American social and political history, especially the radical leftist movements of the 1920s and 1930s. Researchers interested in the roots of feminism in the United States should also find these papers useful in documenting the life of a creative and productive woman who was successful in a field then almost entirely dominated by men. Correspondents of note include her husband Berkeley Tobey, lovers Geoffrey Eaton and Albert Robert, writers Ray Bradbury and Theodore Dreiser, and artists and architects, such as Dorothy Grotz, Craig Ellwood, A. Quincy Jones, Hans Hollein, and J. R. Davidson. General correspondence is primarily with researchers, professors, architects, publishers, and professional organizations.</p>
            <p>Personal writings include McCoy's diaries, notebooks, and memoirs, and writings by others including friends, lovers, and colleagues. Also included are drafts of McCoy's fictional works, both published and unpublished, including short stories, teleplays, and novels.</p>
            <p>The collection contains in-depth documentation of McCoy's pioneering study of the modernist work of twentieth-century architects in Southern California. The bulk of her papers consist of her writing files for books, exhibition catalogs, articles, and lectures on architecture. Because many of the architects about whom McCoy wrote were her contemporaries, she developed personal relationships with several of them through her research and writing. Her writing files include drafts, notes, research material, photographs, and correspondence. McCoy also traveled extensively, particularly in Italy and Mexico, and wrote about architecture, craft, and culture in those countries. Project files document McCoy's other activities related to architectural history, such preservation projects, juries, grants, the Dodge House Preservation Campaign and related film project, her work for the Society of Architectural Historians and the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), and her work at the UCLA School of Architecture and Urban Planning, compiling a slide library and cataloging the Richard Neutra's papers. McCoy also maintained architect files which may contain correspondence, notes, photographs, research material, interview transcripts, about architects and their works. Among these extensive records, the files documenting the careers of R. M. Schindler, Irving Gill, Richard Neutra, and Juan O'Gorman are particularly rich.</p>
            <p>Printed material in this collection documents McCoy's career as well as her personal interests. Included are books, clippings, magazines, newsletters, press releases, as well as publications arranged by subject such as architecture, art, Italy, and Mexico. McCoy also collected literary and leftist publications. The small amount of artwork in this collection consists of artwork sent to her by friends, including a drawing of her by Esther Rollo and etchings by various artists including Thomas Worlidge.</p>
            <p>There are personal photographs of family and friends and of McCoy at different times in her life, as well as photographs gathered during the course of her research on architecture. Found here are photographs of architects and their works, including a large number depicting the work of Gregory Ain, Luis Barragan, J. R. Davidson, Irving Gill, Bernard Maybeck, Juan O'Gorman, R. M. Schindler, and Raphael Soriano. Many of these photographs were taken by notable architectural photographers Julius Shulman and Marvin Rand. Also found are photographs of architecture designed for the Case Study House program of 
                <emph render="italic">Arts &amp; Architecture </emph>magazine; exhibition photographs, primarily for the exhibition "Ten Italian Architects" in 1967; and other research photographs primarily documenting architecture and craft in other countries and the history of architecture in California. This series also includes approximately 3,600 slides of architecture.</p>
            <p>Audio and video recordings include a videocassette of McCoy's 80th birthday party and 55 taped interviews with architects, people associated with architectural projects, and artists.</p>

                    <p>Material found in this series includes resumes, wills, awards, address books, passports and other official identification, as well as a transcript from an interview of McCoy from 1984. One folder contains biographical statements, publication lists, and resumes for McCoy with related notes and correspondence. Also found is a notebook of a radical writers group, correspondence and legal documentation relating to a property dispute in Santa Monica, California, and documentation regarding McCoy witnessing a raid on the John Reed Club in Los Angeles.</p>
                    <p>The two folders of material relating to Theodore Dreiser include a transcript of proceedings for his funeral in 1945, Dreiser's pen knife, and two newspaper articles written by McCoy. There is a wallet that presumably belonged to R.M. Schindler and contains Schindler's business cards and fragments from a 1918 calendar with notes.</p>
                    <p>This series also contains McCoy family documents including genealogy notes, memorabilia, and reports of deaths. Unless the name of another family member is mentioned in the folder title it can be assumed that material found here relates specifically to Esther McCoy, with the exception of a folder of wills, which contains a 1948 letter relating to James L. McCoy's will.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains personal correspondence between McCoy and her friends, lovers, and colleagues. The letters concern McCoy's personal and love relationships, her views on politics, culture, and the literary world, and her struggles as a writer.</p>
                        <p>Correspondence between McCoy and lovers, including Geoffrey Eaton, John Mitchell, John Vick, Albert Robert (also known as "Timmie"), and her husband, Berkeley Tobey, is especially well represented. Much of the extensive correspondence between McCoy and Albert Robert is undated. A few letters between McCoy and her lovers include photographs.</p>
                        <p>There is also significant correspondence with fellow writers, including Theodore Dreiser, Ray Bradbury, Millen Brand, John Collier, John Cowper Powys, and historian Lewis Mumford. Correspondence with Ray Bradbury includes discussions of theater, art and architecture. Letters from Helen Dreiser include Dreiser's opinions on manuscripts written by McCoy. Theodore Dreiser's letters provide insight into the research assignments McCoy carried out for Dreiser and his opinions of her writing. The letters include the typescript of a poem, possibly written by Dreiser. William A. Swanberg, who wrote a book on Dreiser, sought McCoy's opinions and impressions of the author, and their correspondence includes many observations and theories concerning Dreiser's personal life. Also of note is extensive correspondence between McCoy and her close friend Katheryn (Kay) Metz.</p>

                        <p>Found here are notebooks kept by McCoy throughout her professional career. The notebooks consist of travel itineraries, travel notes, notes about architecture and folk art seen during trips, notes on interviews with architects, notes about architects and buildings, notes for articles, and other miscellaneous jottings and writings. The notebooks are difficult to decipher, as most were handwritten in pencil.</p>

                        <p>This series contains autobiographical writings by Esther McCoy documenting various moments in her life. Many of these writings are in a short story format and were given a title by McCoy. Subjects covered in her memoirs, some of which were published, include her mother, childhood, and living in New York and Malibu. Also of note is the piece of writing titled "Geoff/Bo: Paris" describing her time in Paris in 1928 and her relationship with Geoffrey Eaton, and the story "Happy Birthday RMS" about working for architect R. M. Schindler. A folder of manuscripts about Theodore Dreiser contains drafts of three manuscripts relating to Helen and Theodore Dreiser and other literary figures McCoy knew in New York during the 1920s and 1930s. One titled manuscript about Dreiser, "Outward Journey" (1946-1947), can also be found in this subseries.</p>

                        <p>Fictional works found in this subseries include drafts of novels, short stories, and teleplays written by McCoy. A folder of stories submitted to H.L. Mencken includes introductions endorsing the stories by Theodore Dreiser and Edgar Lee Masters with related correspondence. Many of the short stories in this subseries were published in literary magazines and journals, and files may contain correspondence regarding publication and related notes. Of note is a series of files for McCoy's short story, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Pepper Tree</emph>, which includes related writings and research material about Japanese internment camps during World War II.</p>
                        <p>The life of a California architect forms the basis for drafts of three novels, 
                            <emph render="italic">L.A. L.A.</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Vickery Job</emph>, and 
                            <emph render="italic">Ward and Associates</emph>. These three sets of draft manuscripts appear to be closely connected, although it is not clear if they were stages in the development of a single novel. Other draft novels found here include 
                            <emph render="italic">Land Gerard</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">June is the Cruelest Month</emph>, and 
                            <emph render="italic">The Wind's Eye</emph>. None of these novels were published.</p>

                        <p>Works of Fiction are arranged by title. In some cases McCoy used more than one title for a developing story, and alternative titles are provided in parentheses. Numbers were assigned to drafts to facilitate research and do not necessarily indicate that the drafts were written sequentially according to the numbers. Though an effort has been made to ensure that related papers are filed together, most of the drafts are undated, and it is impossible to be sure when, and in what order, they were written. Date spans for folders may indicate the date writing began and/or the date of publication and sale. Where possible, these dates have been taken from notations on the manuscripts or from information provided on publication lists.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains records of McCoy's work on several exhibition catalogs. McCoy worked on major museum exhibitions about architecture, such as 
                            <emph render="italic">Blueprints for Modern Living</emph> at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; 
                            <emph render="italic">Ten Italian Architects</emph> at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and 
                            <emph render="italic">High Styles</emph> at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In some instances she was a curator for the exhibition and wrote the catalog, and in others she was asked to contribute an essay for the catalog. Files include correspondence, published catalogs, draft writings and photographs used for the catalogs, notes and research material, publicity and reviews, and other documentation of exhibition details. Of particular note are a video about the Case Study House Program that was released in conjunction with the 
                            <emph render="italic">Blueprints for Modern Living</emph> exhibition, and documentation regarding theft of items from the 
                            <emph render="italic">Juan O'Gorman</emph> exhibition.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains many of the lectures given by McCoy at museums, galleries, universities, colleges, and architecture societies. Some of the lectures are for classes that McCoy taught at the University of California (Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz) between 1965 and 1975. Others are exhibition and gallery lectures for the shows that she curated. Also included are lectures and talks she gave regarding her publications and tours. Files may consist of drafts of lectures, notes, and related printed material. One lecture, "Schindler in California" was released by Pidgeon Audio Visual as part of a series of talks about architecture. Included are a sound cassette of the lecture by McCoy and series of 24 slides. This subseries also includes two files of schedules and notes for house tours that McCoy led for various organizations.</p>

                        <p>Found here are documents regarding the campaign to preserve the architecturally significant Dodge House, built by Irving Gill. Preservation efforts began in 1963 and continued until the house was demolished in 1970. Esther McCoy was very active in the preservation efforts, serving on the Citizen's Committee for the Dodge House and a Dodge House Special Committee of the American Institute of Architects. This subseries includes various committee documents, clippings and other printed material, correspondence, and notes and writings by McCoy regarding the preservation efforts. In 1965 McCoy produced a film, "Dodge House" as part of the preservation efforts. Documentation of this film project includes correspondence, photographs used for the film, draft film scripts written by McCoy, and a film reel of the finished film.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains documentation about the "L. A. Art Index," a project coordinated in 1980 by California State University, Long Beach, to compile an index of artists and art groups (including architects and photographers) working in Los Angeles in the 1930s. Esther McCoy conducted research and compiled information for this project. Found here are correspondence, a portion of a draft index (stops at Gh-), and the "Master File" containing photocopies of a card file used for the index.</p>

                        <p>Esther McCoy was a lecturer at the UCLA School of Architecture and Urban Planning from 1965 to 1969. The school was established just a year earlier, and she took an active role in the development of a program curriculum, architecture library, and slide library. This subseries documents her many activities at the school. Included are correspondence, employment records, general notes, and library committee reports. Also found is documentation of her work to establish a slide library, including reports, notes, and inventories. McCoy also oversaw the organization and cataloging of the Richard Neutra Archive, which had been donated to UCLA. Found here is correspondence regarding the project, a microfilm inventory, and collection descriptions. This subseries also contains four files of McCoy's teaching materials, such as lecture notes and course outlines. Researchers should note that McCoy's teaching materials from other Universities can be found in Series 4.4: Lectures.</p>

                    <p>This series contains McCoy's research files on individual architects and their projects. Files may include correspondence, research material, photographs of the architects and their works, writings, interview transcripts and notes, blueprints, and printed material. Writings found here include writings by McCoy and writings by the architects. Of note is a draft memoir written by Konrad Wachsman and an essay on architecture in Mexico by Juan O'Gorman. This series also contains a large amount of material about R. M. Schindler, including statements by other architects about Schindler, and a two volume "Book of Documents" created by Schindler, containing copies of his biographical and professional records.</p>

                        <p>Found here are photographs of works by architects, which McCoy compiled for her books, exhibition catalogs, articles, and other professional projects. Photographs primarily depict architecture by Southern California architects, but also including works by architects working elsewhere in the United States, Italy, and Mexico. Some of these photographs also document architecture by young architects working in the U.S. during the mid-1960s. Photographs depict various interior and exterior views, construction, and occasionally found are photographs of the architect. A large number of photographs found here depict the work of Gregory Ain, Luis Barragan, J. R. Davidson, Irving Gill, Bernard Maybeck, Juan O'Gorman, R. M. Schindler, and Raphael Soriano. Photographs were taken by Esther McCoy, prominent architectural photographers Marvin Rand and Julius Shulman, and many others.</p>

                        <p>Files are arranged alphabetically by name of architect; works by that architect are arranged chronologically by construction date. Date of construction is included in parentheses when it is known. When only one or two photographs represent the work of an architect, it was placed in a file of "Miscellaneous Architects, A-Z." Researchers should note that additional photographs of architects and architecture can be found in Series 4: Architectural Writings, Series 5: Projects, and Series 6: Architect Files.</p>

                        <p>Found here are photographs of architecture designed for the Case Study House program. McCoy researched and wrote about this program extensively, and researchers should note that additional photographs of these houses can be found within her writing files in Series 4 for both her book, 
                            <emph render="italic">Modern California Houses: Case Study Houses 1946-1962</emph>, and the exhibition catalog, 
                            <emph render="italic">Blueprints for Modern Living: History and Legacy of the Case Study House</emph>. Some of these files also include a photograph of the architect(s). Most of the photographs were taken by Esther McCoy, Julius Shulman, Marvin Rand, or the architect.</p>

                        <p>This subseries consists of exhibition photographs, the bulk of which document the 1967 exhibition "Ten Italian Architects" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Photograph documentation of this exhibition includes installation views and photographs used for the exhibition catalog. Other photographs related to this exhibition are arranged by name of architect. Not all of the photographs found here were used in the catalog. Researchers should note that additional documentation of this exhibition catalog, written by McCoy, can be found among her architectural writings in Series 4.2: Exhibition Catalogs. Additional files in this subseries include installation views of an exhibition of work by Antoni Gaudi and copies of photographs used in three other exhibitions.</p>

                        <p>Found here are photographs which were primarily compiled by McCoy as research photographs during her work as a writer. Many of these photographs were taken to accompany her series of travel articles written for the Los Angeles Times. Files are arranged by subject, and often document craft and architecture in various countries such as Italy, Mexico, Brazil, and Israel. Also found are files of photographs documenting California architectural history. Researchers should note that related photographs may be found among McCoy's architectural writings in Series 4.</p>

                    <p>Found here are interview recordings, commercially produced music recordings, and a videocassette of Esther McCoy's 80th birthday party. Interview recordings include taped, untranscribed interviews with architects, people associated with architectural projects, and artists. Recordings were made either on sound tape reels (3 in., 1/4 in. tape) or sound cassettes. All interviews were conducted by Esther McCoy, unless otherwise noted, as part of her research for magazine articles and books, including many interviews from 1964 and 1965 which were used for her article, "Young Architects: The Small Office," published in 
                        <emph render="italic">Arts &amp; Architecture</emph> magazine (February/March 1966).</p>
