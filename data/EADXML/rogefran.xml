<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Rogers decided to give their son, Frances Rogers, the middle name of Millet to honor the artist Francis Davis Millet.  The Rogers were friends with the artist's brother, Charles Sumner Millet. Francis Millet Rogers became a scholar of Portuguese language and history who was a member of the romance languages and literature faculty at Harvard University, where he later served as Dean.  Between 1945 and 1955, he researched the life and works of the man for whom he was named. Professor Rogers' manuscript, "Frank D. Rogers: American of the Americans," remains unpublished.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Correspondence includes letters to the Bank of Pittsburgh, 1897-1910, from a shipping agent and F. D. Millet concerning their lunette that will be arriving from England, and receipt of a medal sent to Millet later. Most likely, Dr. Rogers obtained these items from the bank during the course of his research.  Research correspondence of Francis Millet Rogers with various individuals and institutions, 1945-1955, concerns the life and works of F. D. Millet.</p>
<p>The Reference Notes File, originally in a loose leaf notebook, contains sections titled "F/.D.M.'s paintings (easel)," "F.D.M.'s paintings (mural)," "miscellaneous productions," and "source materials."  Also included are two small stacks of index cards recording bibliographic citations and miscellaneous notes.</p>
<p>Reproductions of Millet's Work includes brochures with photographic reproductions and catalogs containing only descriptive text.  A booklet titled "The Minnesota Capitol" (frames 384-386) was not in the folder when examined in 2003; it is not known if this item was among the printed material from this collection that went to Smithsonian Libraries in 1976, or if it was removed at a later date (see "Separated Material").</p>
<p>Photographs include undated copy prints; a few items are printed reproductions of photographs.  Included are  a bas relief portrait of Francis Davis Millet by Saint Gaudens, 1879, and photographs of Millet by Davis and Sanford, N.Y., circa 1910. There are several photographs of Millet's easel paintings and murals, as well as exterior views of New Jersey courthouses for which murals were commissioned. In addition, there are photographs of a monument to victims of the Titanic and views of a monument to Francis Davis Millet and Archibald Willingham Butt in Washington, D. C.  Also included are a "Millet lamp post" in Washington, D.C, a reproduction of the fa√ßade of the Octagon, Washington, D. C., and photographs of  various medals designed by Millet.</p>
