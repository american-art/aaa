<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>As a very young woman, Edith Gregor Halpert (1900-1970) attended art school sporadically while pursuing a business career that began in advertising and included work as a personnel manager and efficiency expert. She continued her business career after marrying artist Samuel Halpert (1884-1930) in 1918 and eventually became a highly paid executive with an investment firm. Well-invested bonuses provided the capital for Halpert to open her own business.</p>
<p>In November 1926, Halpert and business partner Berthe (Bea) Kroll Goldsmith opened Our Gallery at 113 West 13th Street for the purpose of promoting a group of progressive American artists, many of whom were friends of Edith and Samuel Halpert. The following year, at the suggestion of William Zorach, the gallery changed its name to Downtown Gallery--emphasizing its Greenwich Village location, unique for the time--and the name survived despite relocation to midtown Manhattan (to 43 East 51st Street in 1940, to 32 East 51st Street in 1945, and to the Ritz Tower Concourse at 465 Park Avenue in 1965).</p>
<p>The Downtown Gallery specialized in contemporary American art. An early gallery brochure states: "The Downtown Gallery has no prejudice for any one school. Its selection is driven by quality--by what is enduring--not by what is in vogue." Some of the artists affiliated with the Downtown Gallery from its early years were Stuart Davis, "Pop" Hart, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Charles Sheeler, Max Weber, and William and Marguerite Zorach. In its original location, the gallery served as a place where artists (many of whom lived and worked in the neighborhood), collectors, and others interested in American art met in the evenings for coffee, conversation, and sometimes lectures or other formal programs. Holger Cahill (1887-1960) entered into a partnership with Halpert and Goldsmith in 1929 when they founded the American Folk Art Gallery, the first ever of its kind; the American Folk Art Gallery opened on the second floor of the Downtown Gallery in 1931. Folk art was an important feature of the gallery throughout its history, though the name American Folk Art Gallery does not appear to have been used consistently. Because the profit margin was high and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller bought avidly for her growing collection, folk art revenues subsidized contemporary art exhibitions and helped the gallery survive the Depression. The Daylight Gallery, also run by Halpert and Goldsmith, opened in 1930 in a separate structure behind the main gallery, and continued until the Downtown Gallery moved to East 51st Street in 1940. Its purpose was to exhibit painting and sculpture to best advantage in a gallery designed to diffuse light perfectly and to demonstrate how works of art may be used as architectural embellishments in a modern building. Other subsidiary galleries operated by the Downtown Gallery were the John Marin Room, opened in 1950 and run by John Marin, Jr., and the Ground-Floor Room, 1951, "dedicated to the adventurous, less experienced collector willing to gamble on his taste and ours."</p>
<p>From the beginning, Halpert endeavored to hold prices at reasonable levels; she employed aggressive marketing and advertising techniques learned from her career in business and banking, offering extended payment plans without interest to buyers of modest means. She recognized the value of placing representative works by Downtown Gallery artists in important art museums and public collections, even if a price reduction was necessary to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>After purchasing Goldsmith's share of the business in 1935, Halpert, needing to earn a profit, reorganized the gallery as a more overtly commercial venture. The roster of artists was reduced to twelve. Those eliminated tended to be younger artists, most of whom were supported by WPA work. Eventually, the roster expanded; new additions were usually artists not based in New York, whom Halpert learned of through her work as an adviser to the WPA Federal Art Project. Halpert had long courted Alfred Stieglitz's artists, and in the years following his death in 1946 a number of them affiliated with the Downtown Gallery. Another change was that the Downtown Gallery no longer represented only living American artists; the gallery began handling a number of estates, most notably that of Arthur Dove. In 1953, the roster of Downtown Gallery artists shifted dramatically when Halpert entered into an agreement with Charles Alan. Alan had been hired in 1945 with the understanding that he was being trained to run the Downtown Gallery upon Halpert's retirement five years in the future. Eight years later, it became apparent that Halpert was not going to retire; without consulting the artists, she transferred representation of all artists who had joined the Downtown Gallery since 1936 to the newly established Alan Gallery.</p>
<p>Exhibitions at the Downtown Gallery included both solo exhibitions and group shows usually built around a theme; most lasted about a month. Annual exhibitions (sometimes titled anniversary exhibitions) opened the exhibition season each fall and showcased the gallery's artists. The Downtown Gallery's Christmas show, a long-standing event that encouraged purchases of original art for holiday gift giving, was eagerly anticipated as it featured fine artwork at very reasonable prices. Between 1927 and 1935, the Downtown Gallery was the site of the American Print Makers Society annual exhibitions. During its forty-seven years in operation, the Downtown Gallery organized many important, influential exhibitions. <emph render="italic">American Ancestors</emph> (1931) presented American folk art as the precursor to and direct influence on the contemporary art featured by the Downtown Gallery. The title was used for a number of subsequent exhibitions and became a synonym for folk art. <emph render="italic">American Folk Art Sculpture: Index of American Design, Federal Art Project</emph> (1937) featured drawings by WPA artists recording objects that documented America's material culture and artistic heritage. Along with the Index of American Design drawings, the exhibition included a number of the original sculptures from the Downtown Gallery's inventory and borrowed from folk art collector Abby Aldrich Rockefeller.</p>
<p><emph render="italic">William Harnett: "Nature-Vivre" </emph> (1939) reintroduced the nineteenth-century artist whose trompe l'oeil paintings had been collected by Halpert over a period of years expressly for this purpose. Between 1947 and 1949, a controversy ensued over paintings--some of which had been sold by the Downtown Gallery--with the signature of William Harnett but discovered by <emph render="italic">San Francisco Chronicle </emph>art critic Alfred Frankenstein to be the work of Harnett's student, John Peto. Halpert had purchased the questionable pieces in good faith, completely unaware of the added signatures, and she defended her attributions, despite evidence to the contrary. Frankenstein publicized his discovery widely; while neither Halpert nor the Downtown Gallery were named directly, their identity was apparent to his well-informed readers. The situation was further inflamed when additional articles by Frankenstein failed to include new evidence favorable to Halpert and the Downtown Gallery.</p>
<p>Another major exhibition was <emph render="italic">American Negro Art, 19th and 20th Centuries</emph> (1941-1942), the first show of its kind held at a commercial gallery. Held at the Downtown Gallery, the exhibition was sponsored by a committee of prominent citizens including Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, Archibald MacLeish, A. Philip Randolph, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Among its aims were to raise money for the Negro Art Fund, to promote museum acquisitions of work by black artists, and to encourage galleries to represent the living participants. In addition to providing its facilities, the Downtown Gallery donated all sales commissions to the Negro Art Fund and added Jacob Lawrence to its roster of artists.</p>
<p>Edith Gregor Halpert played important roles in a number of exhibitions and major art projects that were not connected with the Downtown Gallery. She served as organizer and director of the First Municipal Exhibition of American Art, Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1929. Beginning in 1932, Halpert was extensively involved with Radio City Music Hall arts projects. She conceived, organized, and handled publicity for the <emph render="italic">First Municipal Art Exhibition</emph> (also known as the <emph render="italic">Forum Exhibition</emph>) sponsored by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and held at Radio City Music Hall in 1934. As an adviser to the WPA Federal Art Project, Halpert spent the summer of 1936 in Washington, D.C., developing its Exhibition and Allocation Program, which registered works of art arriving from regional project centers and selected pieces for traveling exhibitions that circulated throughout the country. In 1937, she formed the Bureau for Architectural Sculpture and Murals, a central clearinghouse from which architects could review and select work by artists and sculptors experienced in working in architectural settings. Halpert served as curator of the art section of the <emph render="italic">American National Exhibition</emph>, sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the U.S. Department of Commerce; she traveled to the Soviet Union with the exhibition, installed the show, and gave daily gallery talks in Russian. In 1952, to promote art history, Halpert established the Edith Gregor Halpert Foundation. Its activities included assisting universities to fund scholarships for the study of contemporary American art and championing the rights of artists to control the sale and reproduction of their work. For her "outstanding contribution to American art," Halpert received the Art in America Award in 1959. She also received a USIA Citation for Distinguished Service in 1960, and the University of Connecticut awarded her its First Annual International Silver Prize for "distinguished contribution to the arts" in 1968.</p>
<p>In addition to being an art dealer, Edith Gregor Halpert was also a collector of contemporary American art and American folk art. For many years, Halpert and the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., discussed a gift of a substantial number of paintings to form the nucleus of a new wing to be called the Gallery of 20th-Century American Art. After numerous disagreements and misunderstandings by both parties, the plan was abandoned. While negotiations were still in progress, the Edith Gregor Halpert Collection was exhibited in two installments, 1960 and 1962, at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. During the following two years, portions of her collection traveled to Santa Barbara, Honolulu, and San Francisco. Other exhibitions, drawn completely from the Edith Gregor Halpert Collection, include <emph render="italic">American Modernism: The First Wave, Painting from 1903-1933</emph>, presented at Brandeis University Museum of Art, 1963; <emph render="italic">Six Decades of American Art</emph>, shown at Leicester Galleries, London, 1965; <emph render="italic">Image to Abstraction</emph>, held at Amon Carter Museum, 1967; and <emph render="italic">Edith Halpert and the Downtown Gallery</emph>, exhibited at the University of Connecticut, 1968. The Edith Gregor Halpert Collection was eventually sold at auction by Sotheby Parke-Bernet, 1973. </p><p>Dr. Dianne's Tepfer's dissertation (1989) on Edith Gregor Halpert was an invaluable resource in arranging and describing the records of Downtown Gallery; her chronology was consulted often in constructing this Historical Note.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Downtown Gallery records constitute 109 linear feet on 167 reels of microfilm. The records are dated 1824 to 1974 with bulk dates from 1926 to 1969.</p>
<p>The Downtown Gallery was established in 1926 as Our Gallery and operated under the name Downtown Gallery from 1927 until 1973. Nineteenth-century material consists of items acquired by Edith Gregor Halpert for research purposes or to document works of art in the gallery's inventory. The few records postdating the closing of the gallery relate to the estate of Edith Gregor Halpert.</p>
<p>The extensive records of the Downtown Gallery present a comprehensive portrait of a significant commercial gallery that operated as a successful business for more than forty years, representing major contemporary American artists and engendering appreciation for early American folk art. Edith Halpert, the gallery's founder and director, was an influential force in the American art world for a large part of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Personal papers are intermingled with the business records of the Downtown Gallery. Many of the artists represented by the gallery were Halpert's personal friends, and over the years she developed social relationships and friendships with many clients. These relationships are reflected by the contents of the records, especially the correspondence, some of which is purely personal. In addition, there are a small number of letters from relatives, photographs of Halpert's family, home and friends, and limited information about her country house and personal finances. </p>
<p>The Downtown Gallery records consist largely of correspondence with collectors, including Edgar and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch, Preston Harrison, Mr. and Mrs. Maxim Karolik, William H. Lane, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Beram K. Saklatwalla, Robert Tannahill, and Electra Havemeyer Webb; with dealers, including robert Carlen, Landau Gallery, Leicester Galleries, Mirski Gallery, and Isabel Carleton Wilde; and with large numbers of curators and museum directors, including many affiliated with university museums. In addition, there is correspondence concerning routine gallery business and administrative affairs.</p>
<p>Artist files and an extensive series of notebooks (American Folk Art Gallery notebooks, artist notebooks, and publicity notebooks) compiled by gallery staff contain a wide variety of material and are a rich source of information about individual artists and the Downtown Gallery's exhibition history.</p>
<p>Business records include exhibition records, stock records, sales records, transit records, financial records, lists of artwork and clients, legal documents, minutes, insurance records, research files, and architectural plans.</p>
<p>Writings by Edith Gregor Halpert consist of articles on American folk art, speeches, and short stories; also included are her school notebooks and "Daily Thoughtlets" compiled at age seventeen. All writings by other authors are on art subjects, and most are texts or introductions for exhibition catalogs.</p>
<p>Among the miscellaneous records are biographical material on Edith Gregor Halpert and Samuel Halpert, works of art by Edith Gregor Halpert and other artists, artifacts, and audiovisual materials. The artifacts include wooden weather vane molds and supporting documentation as well as awards presented to Halpert. Audiovisual materials are 16-mm motion picture films of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Corporation television series, <emph render="italic">America: The Artist's Eye</emph>, produced between 1961 and 1963 in association with Jensen Productions. An additional 16-mm motion picture film includes "tails out" footage of Charles Sheeler at home and at work, circa 1950. A copy of the program about Sheeler, along with the "tails out" material, is also on videocassette. In addition, there is a sound recording of a talk on collecting given by Halpert's client, folk art collector Maxim Karolik, in 1962.</p>
<p>Printed matter consists of items produced by the Downtown Gallery, including exhibition catalogs, checklists, invitations, announcements, and press releases. There are also news clippings about Halpert, the Downtown Gallery, and the Edith Gregor Halpert Collection; other art-related clippings are arranged topically. Miscellaneous printed matter not produced by the Downtown Gallery includes newsletters, press releases, publications of art organizations, and reproductions of artwork. A selection of twenty-five volumes from the personal library of Edith Gregor Halpert has been retained.</p>
<p>The photographs series includes images of people: Edith Gregor Halpert, family, friends, also many images of her dog, Adam, and views of her country home in Newtown, Connecticut. Other photographs of people include portraits of artists, most of whom were affiliated with the Downtown Gallery. There are also photographs of works of art (with a large number of black-and-white negatives, 35-mm color slides, and glass plate negatives) and of exhibitions, of the exterior and interior of the Downtown Gallery, and of an award presented to Halpert.</p>

<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>It is not certain how well arranged the files were while still the property of the gallery, though Halpert's background as an efficiency expert and her talents as an organizer suggest that the gallery's records were well maintained. It is clear, however, that much of the original order has been lost; Halpert is known to have removed files, including many records concerning the Harnett-Peto controversy.</p>
<p>Correspondence (Series 1) is arranged chronologically, and Artist Files (Series 2) is arranged alphabetically. The remaining series are organized into subseries that reflect either a function or specific record type, and the arrangement of each is explained in the detailed series descriptions.</p>
<p>The Downtown Gallery records are arranged into eight series: </p>

<acqinfo encodinganalog="541" id="a19">
<head>Provenance</head>
<p>Between 1957 and 1967, the Downtown Gallery loaned portions of its records to the Archives of American Art for microfilming. Because the microfilming was done in increments, the material was not always filmed in logical sequence, and overlapping and duplication of records occurred. Since files loaned for microfilming were, for the most part, still working records used to conduct ongoing gallery business, their contents changed and shifted over time. After Edith Halpert's death in 1970, the records of the Downtown Gallery were received by the Archives of American Art, 1972-1978, as a gift from her niece and executor, Nathaly Baum. In addition to the previously microfilmed material, the gift includes correspondence, inventories and sales records, financial records, photographs, and printed matter, as well as artifacts.</p>

<head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Through the generosity of the Henry Luce Foundation, Inc., the Archives of American Art has been able to process and microfilm the Downtown Gallery records and publish this finding aid for use with the microfilm. Related records, now more logically ordered into archival series, are arranged and described according to prevailing archival standards to facilitate access. The collection was processed by Catherine Stover Gaines and Lisa Lynch in 2000. Dr. Diane Tepfer's dissertation (1989) on Edith Gregor Halpert was an invaluable resource in arranging and describing the records of the Downtown Gallery; her chronology was the point of departure for our work.</p>

<p>Also included is personal correspondence of Edith Gregor Halpert.

<p>Artist files consist mainly of correspondence with Edith Gregor Halpert and the Downtown Gallery and may include biographical notes, writings, press releases, original artwork, exhibition information, and printed matter. Following the individual artist files are files titled "Various Artists" that contain similar information about Downtown Gallery exhibitions and group shows elsewhere featuring Downtown Gallery artists. Also included with "Various Artists" is a manuscript titled <emph render="italic">Art in America</emph> (author not cited) and pages from an unidentified publication, both featuring biographies of Downtown Gallery artists.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Various reference files, stored in three-ring binders and always referred to as "notebooks," were compiled and maintained by the Downtown Gallery. Notebooks were among the records the Downtown Gallery loaned to the Archives of American Art for microfilming in 1957 and 1967. Between their initial microfilming and subsequent donation, additions and/or deletions were made in many notebooks. All have been refilmed; thus, this set of microfilm reflects what is now owned by the Archives of American Art.</p>
<p>Notebooks are categorized as: American Folk Art Gallery Notebooks (5 linear feet), Artist Notebooks (22.5 linear feet), and Publicity Notebooks (5 linear feet). All contain large numbers of photographs, notes, and printed matter mounted on sheets of paper punched for three-ring binders; but over the years, many items have become detached. The contents were removed from their binders many years ago, and exact titles of some volumes may not have been recorded.</p> 
</scopecontent>
<arrangement><p>This series is arranged into three subseries:

<scopecontent> 
<p>American Folk Art Gallery notebooks contain information about folk art handled by the Downtown Gallery and its American Folk Art Gallery, as well as general information on the subject.</p> 
</scopecontent>
<arrangement>
<p>The records are arranged by medium: oil paintings; watercolors; drawings; lithographs; fraktur; miscellaneous; paintings on velvet; embroideries; paintings on glass; tinsels; shaker furniture; and sculpture. Those media with extensive files are further subdivided by more specific media type or by subject. The series ends with subject files including notes and photographs of American folk art and other records which were possibly research material for a book.</p></arrangement>

<unittitle>Publicity Notebooks,  <unitdate>1901-1969, undated</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>Publicity notebooks consist of clippings, press releases, exhibition announcements, invitations, and catalogs, and occasionally include photographs and notes. Separate series of notebooks were compiled and maintained for group shows at the Downtown Gallery and group shows in other locations. Group shows in other locations included shows organized by the Downtown Gallery and featuring Downtown Gallery loans, purchases, or affiliated artists. Separate notebooks were also maintained for American folk art exhibitions at the Downtown Gallery and folk art shows elsewhere.</p>
<p>This subseries also contains miscellaneous publicity records. Miscellaneous publicity relating to American folk art in the 1950s includes separate sections of records for five collections that relied heavily on Halpert's expertise and contained significant artwork acquired through the Downtown Gallery.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous publicity relating to artists A to Z includes the following artists: Archipenko, Aronson, Ault, Bacon, Baskin, Beerman, Berkowitz, Bloom, Breinin, Brice, Broderson, Brook, Browne, Burlin, Cloar, Coleman, Corson, Crawford, Dahill, Dole, Lachaise, Lebrun, Ottesen, and Stella. Photographs found here picture an opening exhibition of Our Gallery, Inc., 1926; William Zorach with doors he designed for the entrance to the Daylight Gallery, 1930; a plaque by Reuben Nakian over the Zorach doors of the Daylight Gallery, 1930; and Duncan Candler with his door frame in bas relief, circa 1930.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous publicity records for Downtown Gallery relate to solo and group exhibitions and the 1951 opening of the ground-floor room.</p> 
</scopecontent>
<arrangement><p>The series is organized as follows: notebooks for group shows at the Downtown Gallery; notebooks for group shows at other locations; notebooks for American folk art exhibtions at the Downtown Gallery; notebooks for American folk art exhibitions at other locations; and miscellaneous publicity for American folk art, artists A to Z, Downtown Gallery, and foreign artwork.</p></arrangement>

<p>Exhibition files (0.5 linear foot) include an index, exhibition lists, check lists, price lists, and artist data sheets. There are no files for individual shows; the records relating to specific exhibitions are scattered throughout the business correspondence, with auxiliary information appearing in artist files and among the printed matter and publicity notebooks. </p>
<p>Index records include an alphabetical listing of Downtown Gallery exhibitions, indicating dates of each show and whether a catalog and/or publicity material were issued; the index is annotated to indicate page number, "something missing," or "missing in photograph book" (possibly an index to a publicity scrapbook).</p>
<p>The exhibition lists include chronological listings of Downtown Gallery exhibitions, alphabetical listings of one-person shows, and chronological listings of group shows indicating participants in alphabetical order; all lists were compiled by the gallery.</p>
<p>Artist data sheets include questionnaires completed by artists participating in the exhibitions <emph render="italic">Newcomers</emph> (1951), <emph render="italic">Artists of Chicago</emph> (1954), <emph render="italic">Painters of Los Angeles</emph> (1955), and <emph render="italic">7 Artists in Hawaii</emph> (1960).</p>

<head>Index B: List of Downtown Gallery Exhibitions</head>
<p>Below is a chronological listing of Downtown Gallery exhibitions, culled from catalogs and checklists, invitations and announcements, press releases, newspaper reviews, advertisements, lists compiled by gallery staff, and <emph render="italic">The Archives of American Art Collection of Exhibition Catalogs</emph> (1979). Exhibition titles indicated on the announcement or used in a published review sometimes differ from the title of the corresponding exhibition catalog or printed checklist. Catalogs or announcements for most shows will be found with the printed matter produced by the Downtown Gallery (Series 7.1), in the publicity notebooks (Series 3.3.), and/or with artist files (Series 2). Microfilm reel and frame number(s) are noted in parentheses for catalogs or exhibition announcements recorded in <emph render="italic">The Archives of American Art Collection of Exhibition Catalogs</emph> that are not among the Downtown Gallery records.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>This subseries contains stock books and miscellaneous stock records, seven file boxes of inventory cards, and purchase slips.</p> 
<p>Purchase slips consist of Downtown Gallery forms summarizing information about items purchased by the gallery, some with sales receipts attached.</p> 
<p> Stock books that were not filmed but which can be found in this subseries include: Miscellaneous Expenses, 1929-1931 (1 vol.); and Receipts and Disbursements, Feb. 1931-April 1932, Jan. 1935-May 1938 (1 vol.).</p></scopecontent> 
<arrangement><p>Stock books and miscellaneous stock records are followed by inventory cards and purchase slips. The arrangement of the stock volumes varies: some are categorized by type of art (e.g., American folk art), others are in alphabetical order by name of artist, and yet others are keyed to the storage location of the objects. Inventory cards are mostly organized by type of artwork and arranged by stock number. Purchase slips for each year are arranged alphabetically by name of seller.</p></arrangement>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Transit records (6.5 linear feet) consist of receipts issued by the Downtown Gallery for outgoing consignments and artwork received and returned, and receipts issued to the Downtown Gallery. These records were not microfilmed because the more easily accessible correspondence duplicates most information about specific transactions, and the aggregate data presented in this subseries are thought to be of interest to a very limited number of researchers.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous business records (2.5 linear feet) include lists of artwork, many unidentified, which come from a variety of sources and were compiled for various purposes; twenty small loose-leaf notebooks listing names and addresses of clients with dates, titles, and prices of purchases; mailing lists on 3 X 5 index cards; legal documents such as certificates of incorporation, name changes, agreements, contracts, bills of sale, summons, notices of hearings, and bylaws; minutes of a few sporadic meetings of Downtown Gallery artists between 1934 and 1952; insurance records, primarily relating to the American Folk Art Gallery; research files, including material about legal issues of concern to galleries; and architectural plans. Architectural records include various plans for the Corcoran Gallery of Art and the proposed Gallery of 20th Century Art, Halpert's gift to the Corcoran that never materialized. There are also groups of plans relating to the Downtown Gallery's last two locations at 32 East 51st Street and 425 Park Avenue in the Ritz Towers Concourse.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>This subseries contains weather vane artifacts and related material, in addition to two awards. Only the supporting documentation for weather vanes is microfilmed.</p>
<p>Weather vane artifacts include several hand-carved wooden weather vane molds of L. W. Cushing &#x0026; Sons, a prominent nineteenth-century manufacturer, along with a copy of the firm's catalog. During the 1940s, Mrs. Halpert noticed an influx of weather vanes on the market, purported to be nineteenth century and priced accordingly; she doubted their authenticity and searched for the source of the questionable antiques. Molds for those weather vanes and others were discovered in 1953 in the yard of a Chelsea, Massachusetts, scrap metal dealer. Mrs. Halpert learned the dealer, who had acquired them from the last surviving owner of L. W. Cushing &#x0026; Sons, was the innocent source of the "authentic" weather vanes sold in Boston, Maine, and New York. Mrs. Halpert collected the wood and iron molds, wooden models, and tools, and after a year of organizing and assembling the weather vane components, the American Folk Art Gallery arranged for authorized reproductions of the six most aesthetically important models, each in a limited edition of fifty.</p>
<p>The wooden weather vane molds found here are rare. While copper weather vanes were created by pressing sheet copper directly onto the molds or hollowed-out forms, wood was not durable enough for repeated use and popular demand soon required mass-production. These highly detailed molds are in fragile condition. Most are incomplete forms such as the heads, legs or torso of various animals; there are also parts of jockeys, wheels, and Columbia (Lady Liberty). Most were identified and numbered by the American Folk Art Gallery.</p>
<p>Supporting documentation consists of L. W. Cushing &#x0026; Sons Catalogue No. 9, circa 1883; a nineteenth-century printed sheet of weather vane designs; and three display boards containing photographs and printed matter regarding weather vane exhibitions and reproductions.</p><p>The trophy found in this subseries is the First Annual International Silver Prize Medal trophy awarded by the University of Connecticut to Edith Halpert for distinguished contribution to the arts. Established with a grant from the International Silver Company of Connecticut, the award coincided with an exhibit of works from the Downtown Gallery held at the university in 1968. The medal found here is undidentified.</p>

<unittitle>Audiovisual Records, <unitdate>circa 1950-1963</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>This subseries contains a sound recording, a video cassette, three motion picture films, and a DVD.</p>
<p>The sound recording is a 33-1/3 rpm LP record album of a speech inscribed "To Edith Halpert, who knows the Answer--Maxim Karolik." A note on the jacket indicates the speech was transcribed, but a transcript was not found with the gallery records.</p>
<p>The videocassette and three films are of a television series produced by Westinghouse Broadcasting Corporation in association with Jensen Productions,<emph render="italic"> America: The Artist's Eye</emph>. The videocassette is approximately 20 minutes, in black and white, of an edition of the series about Charles Sheeler. It includes discussion of Sheeler's barn paintings, how handmade items influenced him, and the appeal of machines and locomotives. There are also brief segments (circa 1950) showing views of Sheeler, his wife, and other people and animals in various work and leisure activities. </p>
<p>The first motion picture film is a 16-mm film, in color and black and white (13 inch reel), of brief, approximately 5 minute, programs from the series <emph render="italic">America: The Artist's Eye</emph>. Programs are on: American Primitives, Albert Ryder, Charles Willson Peale, John James Audubon, Winslow Homer, Paintings in the White House, George Catlin, John Marin, George Bellows, Edward Forbes, John Trumbull, and Currier and Ives. There is also a copy of the film on DVD.</p>
<p>The second film is a 16-mm film, in black and white (2 5 inch reels, duplicates) of the program on Charles Sheeler described above (the full copy is on videocassette).</p>
<p>The third film is a 16-mm film, in black and white (2 7 inch reels, camera original and duplicate) labeled: "Charles Sheeler film (Tails out): Excerpts in and around his home; some footage of him at work, wife, dog, corn and grain fields (much of the stock is sticky or brittle [incorrect: there is some shrinkage, but, overall, the film is not in bad condition] with bad splice [now repaired], repeat footage [actually 3 takes of certain segments] and some overexposed, possible excess footage from TV film)." Again, the full copy is on videocassette.</p>
