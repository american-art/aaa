<bioghist altrender="biography" encodinganalog="545" id="a2">
<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Charles W. Kraushaar established Kraushaar Galleries in 1885 as a
small store on Broadway near Thirty-first Street in New York City. Initially
the store sold artist materials, photogravures, and reproductions. Drawing on
his previous experience working with William Schause, a leading dealer in
European paintings, Kraushaar soon progressed to selling original watercolors,
paintings, and engravings by European artists, primarily landscapes of the
Barbizon School.</p> 
<p>In 1901 Kraushaar moved the business to 260 Fifth Avenue and with the
assistance of his brother, John F. Kraushaar, began adding more modern French
and American painters to the inventory. Of particular interest to John
Kraushaar was the group of American realists known as "The Eight,"
who had held a self-selected, self-organized exhibition at the Macbeth Gallery
in 1908. The Eight were Arthur B. Davies, William Glackens, Robert Henri,
Ernest Lawson, George Luks, Maurice Prendergast, Everett Shinn, and John Sloan.
Luks, whom John Kraushaar met around 1902, was probably the first major
American artist represented at Kraushaar Galleries. In 1917 John Sloan was
invited to hold his first one-person show at the galleries despite accusations
that his exhibition at the Whitney Studio the previous year had represented a
brutal depiction of life that lacked subtlety and sensitivity.</p> 
<p>When Charles Kraushaar died suddenly in 1917, John assumed control of
the galleries and soon enlisted the assistance of his daughter, Antoinette
Kraushaar. Antoinette had suffered a bout of pneumonia during the influenza
epidemic of 1918 that cut short her education; grooming her for a career in the
galleries was a logical step. Following the end of the First World War,
Kraushaar resumed his buying trips to Europe, often accompanied by Antoinette,
and exhibited works by European artists such as Andr&#x00E9; Derain, Henri Matisse,
Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Vincent Van
Gogh. However, it was the increasing commitment to contemporary American
artists for which the galleries would become best known. In addition to The
Eight, the Kraushaars developed their inventory of American paintings and
etchings with exhibitions of work by artists such as Gifford Beal, Charles
Demuth, Guy P&#x00E8;ne Du Bois, Gaston Lachaise, Jerome Myers, Charles Prendergast,
and Henry Schnakenberg.</p> 
<p>Returning from a buying trip to Europe in 1929, John Kraushaar wrote
to California collector Preston Harrision on July 26 that "the prices
over there, especially for modern pictures are astounding." Nevertheless,
Kraushaar believed that investing in modern art would yield benefits within the
next five years, and he refused to be influenced by museums and critics outside
of New York who were reluctant to agree. He exhibited a healthy disrespect for
museum directors in general, whom he referred to in his letters to Harrision as
"dead heads" who ought to be sent to different art centers of the
world in order to "get in touch with what is going on there" (March
11, 1929).</p> 
<p>Like most of its contemporaries, Kraushaar Galleries suffered
considerably during the Depression of the 1930s and struggled to collect and,
in turn, pay accounts due. On October 5, 1931, John Kraushaar confessed to H.
S. Southam, "Business is very bad with us, and I know that you will treat
it confidentially when I tell you that I have had to sacrifice a good part of
my personal holdings to provide cash for my own business." By 1934 the
rent on the galleries' current location at 680 Fifth Avenue, where Kraushaar
had moved in 1919, was out of all proportion to the amount of business that was
being generated. In 1936, a timely move to 730 Fifth Avenue allowed the family
to effect substantial economies without a disproportionate loss of
business.</p> 
<p>During the 1930s, John Kraushaar's health began to fail, and he was
frequently absent from the galleries. Consequently, Antoinette Kraushaar took
on greater responsibility for the operation of the business with the assistance
of her brother Charles. Although Antoinette was one of few women to hold such a
prominent position in the art business at that time, there is no evidence in
the records to suggest that artists or customers who had been accustomed to
dealing with John Kraushaar had any difficulty accepting the transition in
management from father to daughter.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, collecting accounts remained difficult, and although
business had improved by 1938 it was now stymied by the threat of war in
Europe. The warmth of relations between the Kraushaars and the artists they
handled, and their colleagues, was crucial to Antoinette during these years.
She repeatedly expressed her gratitude for their understanding and assistance
in her letters as she struggled to meet financial obligations and operate the
business in her father's absence, experimenting with different strategies as
she evolved an approach that would sustain the business. In a letter to Gifford
Beal dated August 6, 1941, she spoke of "hellish times" and
stressed, "I have learned a great many things during the past few years
and hope that we are groping our way towards a working solution of our own
affairs at least."</p> 
<p>While there is no question that Antoinette Kraushaar shared her
father's genuine interest in contemporary American artists, the growing
commitment to these artists that was forged during these years was driven in
large part by necessity. By increasing her stock of American art and adding
"younger painters of promise," she was able to sell work in a much
broader price range. Consequently she could reach a wider audience and increase
the likelihood that the business would remain solvent. This method of business
also suited her personality far more than having a very specialized inventory
of highly priced work, an approach that she confessed to J. Lionberger Davis on
December 3, 1940, "requires a particular kind of temperament, and frankly
I neither like it nor believe in it."</p> 
<p>Throughout her career Antoinette imbued the business with her personal
style. She understood that elitism alienated art buyers of moderate income, who
constituted her bread and butter, and believed strongly that the gallery
environment should not be intimidating to potential customers. She corresponded
at length with old and new clients alike, patiently offering advice when asked
and maintaining liberal policies for those who wished to borrow artwork on
approval. She also participated in events that promoted efforts to make art
available to a wider audience, such as a 1951 exhibition and seminar at the
Florida Gulf Coast Art Center that addressed problems of buying and selling
art. She was a two-time board member of the Art Dealers Association of America
and considered the organization to be an important source of support for the
gallery community.</p> 
<p>In her dealings with other commercial galleries and art institutions,
Antoinette Kraushaar exhibited a strong spirit of cooperation and enthusiasm,
consistently lending art to small, locally owned businesses and community
organizations as well as to more established galleries and world-class museums.
She also developed long and mutually beneficial associations with the art
departments of many educational institutions across the country, which proved
to be fertile ground for young and upcoming artists.</p> 
<p>Antoinette Kraushaar exhibited the same honesty and fairness in
dealing with artists as her father had, expressing her opinions of their work
in a forthright manner and maintaining a policy of always looking at the work
of any artist who came to her. She understood the inherent difficulties of
dealing with living artists but relished the excitement of encouraging their
work and watching them develop. On November 14, 1947, in reply to a letter from
the artist Bernard Arnest, in which Arnest apologized for burdening her with
his worries, she reminded him, "One of the functions of a dealer is to
act as a safety valve. Didn't you know?"</p> 
<p>Although she would not retain artists indefinitely if she felt their
work had deteriorated in quality, Antoinette often stressed that she was
prepared to accept little or no initial financial return on the work of artists
who showed promise or whose work held a particular appeal for her. In a letter
of December 30, 1940, she reassured Walt Dehner that the lack of sales from his
recent exhibition would not lead her to withdraw his work from the galleries.
In typically unassuming style she advised Dehner to "go on painting
whatever interests you. We have found that there is no recipe for success,
either artistic or material."</p> 
<p>In the early 1940s Antoinette Kraushaar implemented two changes to her
inventory. Sensing that interest in sculpture was growing, she rearranged the
space to give that medium more room and attention. The market for etchings had
been declining since the late 1930s, and as she reduced this part of her
inventory she also acted on her personal passion for drawings by opening a
small gallery devoted to contemporary American drawings that were priced well
within the range of most customers.</p> 
<p>By the time Kraushaar Galleries moved to 32 East Fifty-seventh Street,
late in 1944, American art had become the main focus of the business. While the
long-standing interest in The Eight and other artists of that period continued,
the galleries also handled contemporaries such as Louis Bouch&#x00E9;, Samuel Brecher,
John Heliker, Andr&#x00E9;e Ruellan, and Karl Schrag. When John Kraushaar died in
December 1946, Antoinette and Charles legally assumed control of the business.
This partnership continued until 1950, when Antoinette assumed sole ownership
of the gallery.</p> 
<p>In 1955 the galleries moved uptown to smaller quarters at 1055 Madison
Avenue, and Antoinette Kraushaar gave up the greater part of her print
business. She was inundated with requests from artists to be allowed a chance
to show her their work, and the galleries' exhibition schedule was always full.
Contemporary artists she now represented included Bernard Arnest, Peggy Bacon,
Russell Cowles, Kenneth Evett, William Dean Fausett, William Kienbusch, Joe
Lasker, and George Rickey, and she continued to exhibit artwork by Charles
Demuth, William Glackens, George Luks, Maurice Prendergast, Boardman Robinson,
and John Sloan.</p> 
<p>By the late 1950s the artists of the generation that her father had
promoted in the early part of the century had died, but Antoinette Kraushaar
had the pleasure of seeing his faith in them come to fruition. In a letter to
Ralph Wilson dated October 20, 1958, she stated with satisfaction, "The
Boston Museum is taking (at long last) a deep interest in (Maurice)
Prendergast, and they will probably do an important show within the next
year." Her correspondence with William Glackens's son Ira in the 1960s
reveals the extent to which Glackens's popularity had grown since his death in
1938, and the market for John Sloan's work had been increasing steadily since
the late 1920s. In 1962 James Penney summed up Kraushaar Galleries' success in
the foreword of a catalog for an exhibition of paintings and sculpture the
galleries had organized with the Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute at Hamilton
College:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Over the years, Kraushaar's has maintained a freshness of viewpoint,
a soundness of judgment and an integrity of practice that have made it one of
the most respected and successful of American galleries. It is one of the few
galleries difficult to type as the representative of a particular style or
fashion, for its concern is with quality. Its fairness and reliability in
dealing both with the artist and the public have become the measure for the
integrity of an American art dealer.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In 1964, Antoinette Kraushaar extended the galleries' property into
the adjacent building. She continued to manage the business for twenty-four
more years, handling contemporary American paintings, drawings, and sculpture
and specializing in the work of early-twentieth-century American painters. In
1988 she retired from day-to-day management of the galleries and died four
years later at the age of ninety. Kraushaar Galleries remains in operation
today at 724 Fifth Avenue under the direction of Carole Pesner (president) and
Katherine Kaplan (director), who joined the gallery in 1959 and 1986
respectively. The galleries continue to show figurative and abstract work by
living American painters and sculptors while also representing, or offering
works by, many of the same artists, such as Gifford Beal, William Glackens, and
John Sloan, that John and Antoinette championed throughout their careers. </p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The records of New York City Kraushaar Galleries measure 91.9 linear feet and date from its establishment in 1885 to 2006.  Three-fourths of the collection documents the gallery's handling of contemporary American paintings, drawings, and sculpture through correspondence with artists, private collectors, museums, galleries, and other art institutions, interspersed with scattered exhibition catalogs and other materials.  Also included are John F. Kraushaar's estate records; artists' files; financial ledgers documenting sales and gallery transactions; consignment and loan records; photographs of artwork; sketchbooks and drawings by James Penney, Louis Bouché, and others; and two scrapbooks.</p>

<p>The collection reflects all activities conducted in the day-to-day administration of the business and relates to the acquisition, consignment, loan, sale, and exhibition of art by twentieth-century American artists and European artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The records document specific arrangements for loans and exhibitions, artist-dealer relations, relationships with public and private collectors, interaction with the art dealer community, and routine requests for information.</p> 

<p>Much of the artist correspondence relates to practical arrangements
for exhibitions of artwork, but in many cases also documents the development of
individual artists and the effect of their relationship with the galleries on
their ability to produce marketable work. Many of the artists represented in
the collection also wrote lengthy letters, particularly to Antoinette
Kraushaar, describing their attitudes to their work and providing insight into
how that work was shaped by events in their personal lives.</p> 
<p>The bulk of the correspondence with museums and institutions concerns
practical arrangements for loans of artwork and provides detailed information
about market prices and insurance values. It offers insight into the general
climate of opinion toward particular artists and styles at any given time.
Correspondence with other galleries and dealers also concerns loans and sales
of artwork but, due to the typically cordial and cooperative nature of
relations between the Kraushaars and their contemporaries, may also provide a
more extensive and personal view of relationships and trends in the art dealer
community. Similarly, while a portion of the correspondence with private
collectors concerns routine requests for information and loans of art on
approval, there is also substantive correspondence documenting the development
of the artistic vision of collectors such as Preston Harrison, Elizabeth S.
Navas, and Duncan Phillips.</p> 
<p>From 1917 to the mid-1930s correspondence was handled mainly by John
Kraushaar, and the bulk of that relating to European galleries and European art
can be found during these years. Although there are only a handful of materials before
1926, records from the 1920s and 1930s document Kraushaar Galleries' growing
commitment to American artists and the climate of the market for their work.
The financial hardships of the Depression are vividly depicted in the numerous
letters written during the 1930s seeking payment on accounts receivable and
requesting extensions on accounts payable. </p> 
<p>From the mid-1930s to 1968 correspondence was conducted primarily by
Antoinette Kraushaar and, to some degree, by her assistants in later years. As
the galleries' focus on American art increased, so did the volume of
correspondence with artists, and the collection is particularly rich during the
1940s and early 1960s.  In later years to 2006, most of the correspondence was conducted by Carol Pesner and gallery assistants.</p> 
<p>The exhibition catalogs included in the collection do not represent a
complete set. Those found are working copies used by the galleries in
preparation for exhibitions and are often annotated with prices or insurance
values. Additional exhibition catalogs can be found on the microfilm described
in the Administrative Information section of this finding aid.</p> 
<p>The majority of Kraushaar Galleries' insurance records can be found in
files relating to the company Wm. E. Goodridge &#x0026; Son, later known as Wm. E.
Goodridge, Inc. Shipping and transportation records are generally filed under
the names of the companies used for such transactions and can primarily be
found under Davies, Turner &#x0026; Co., Hudson Forwarding &#x0026; Shipping Co.,
Railway Express Agency, Inc., and W. S. Budworth &#x0026; Son, and to a lesser
degree under American Railway Express Company, Arthur Lenars &#x0026; Cie., C. B.
Richard &#x0026; Co., De La Rancheraye &#x0026; Co., Hayes Storage, Packing &#x0026;
Removal Service, Inc., and Willis, Faber &#x0026; Co. Ltd.</p> 

<p>The 2008-2009 accretion includes additional correspondence similar in content and with correspondents as described above, as well as some artists' Christmas cards.  However, the bulk of the additional correspondence dates from 1965-2006, with a handful of miscellaneous correspondence from 1877 to the mid-twentieth century. Also found are financial and business records including records from the closing of the John F. Kraushaar estate; over 40 ledgers providing nearly complete documentation of the gallery's sales and transactions from its establishment to 1946; incoming consignment records, including account statements and correspondence with artists, from the 1940s to 2006; and outgoing consignment and loan records from 1899-2006.  The gallery's representation of its stable of artists is documented through artists' files containing printed materials, exhibition catalogs and announcements, price lists, and biographical information, as well as containers of photographs and negatives of artwork.  Also found is a 1933 sketchbook by James Penney, drawings and sketchbooks by Louis Bouché, and two scrapbooks.</p>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351$b" id="a5">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Kraushaar Galleries generally filed all types of records together with correspondence in a
combination of alphabetical and chronological files. Thus financial records,
insurance records, receipts, photographs, and exhibition catalogs can be found
interfiled with general correspondence in Series 1-3. A group of photographs of
artwork maintained separately by Kraushaar Galleries constitutes Series 4. Series 6 was minimally processed separately from Series 1-5, and the arrangement reflects the original order of the addition for the most part.</p>

<p>Records in Series 1-3 were originally filed alphabetically by name of
correspondent and then by month, by a span of several months, or by year. The
alphabetical arrangement has been retained, but to facilitate access the
collection was rearranged so that correspondence was collated by year. From
1901 to 1944 outgoing letters and incoming letters are filed separately; in
1945 some outgoing letters are filed separately, with the bulk of the material
filed together as correspondence; from 1946 to 1968 incoming and outgoing
letters are filed together as correspondence.</p> 
<p>For Series 1-3 organizations or individuals represented by at least 15
letters are filed in separate file folders. All other correspondents are
arranged in general files by letters of the alphabet, with selected
correspondents and subjects noted in parentheses after the folder title.</p> 
<p>Series 2 and several boxes in Series 3 contain a variety of notes and
receipts received and created by Kraushaar Galleries that were originally
unfoldered. The notes can be found in folders adjacent to the receipts and
include handwritten notes of customer names and addresses, financial notes and
calculations, catalogs of exhibitions, invitations and announcements to
exhibitions frequently used as note paper, and other miscellany. Although most
of the miscellaneous notes are undated, they are filed, with the receipts, at
the end of the year to which they appear to relate. For the years 1929 and 1930
Kraushaar Galleries created separate alphabetical files for some of the billing
statements received from other businesses. These have been filed adjacent to
"Miscellaneous Notes" and "Receipts" in the appropriate years.</p> 

<p>Kraushaar Galleries tended to file correspondence with businesses
alphabetically according to the letter of the last name: for example, Wm. E.
Goodridge &#x0026; Son would be filed under G rather than W.</p>

>This series documents John Kraushaar's management of the galleries and the increasing involvement of Antoinette Kraushaar from the 1930s on. Kraushaar Galleries wrote regularly to Gifford Beal, Charles Demuth, William Glackens, Gaston Lachaise, Henry Schnakenberg, and John Sloan during these years, and the records document the galleries' faith in, and growing popularity of, these artists. Correspondence with Charles Prendergast documents the galleries' representation of work by Charles and his brother, Maurice, and letters to Edith Glackens record the galleries' continued representation of William Glackens following his death in 1938. John Kraushaar's letters to Guy P&#x00E8;ne Du Bois record his commitment to the artist's work but also his exasperation with Du Bois's handling of his financial affairs. The increase in letters to a growing group of artists including Russell Cowles, William Dean Fausett, Vaughn Flannery, John Hartell, John Heliker, Boardman Robinson, and Esther Williams in the later portion of the series reflects the development of the galleries' commitment to American art.</p><p
>John Kraushaar's letters to Preston Harrison provide insight into his artistic tastes, his sense of humor, and his pragmatic attitude toward art dealership. Kraushaar's letters to Duncan Phillips document the many transactions that took place between the two men as Phillips was developing his collection of American art in Washington, D.C.</p><p
>Letters regarding loans and sales to prominent institutions and museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago, Carnegie Institute, Cleveland Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, and Whitney Museum of American Art indicate the caliber and importance of the galleries' inventory during a crucial period in the history of American art.</p><p
>John Kraushaar's dealings in European art are documented most extensively in his correspondence with British art dealers Alex. Reid &#x0026; Lef&#x00E8;vre, Ltd. and Ernest Brown and Co., French dealers Etienne Bignou, Paul Guillaume, and J. Allard, and the Dutch company Franz Buffa &#x0026; Zonen. The Kraushaars also dealt extensively in European art with Ottawa dealer J. E. Northwood of James Wilson &#x0026; Co. and in European and American art with Albert Roullier Art Galleries and Chester H. Johnson Galleries in Chicago, and Dalzell Hatfield Galleries in California.</p>
<p>Additional scattered outgoing correspondence dating from 1920-1945 may be found in Series 6.1.</p>

<p>This series contains letters written in response, or relation to,
those in Series 1, and many of the significant correspondents in that series
are also represented in Series 2. Of additional interest is the substantial
correspondence from other artists including Joseph Barber, Gifford Beal,
Reynolds Beal, Randall Davey, Walt Dehner, Charles Demuth, William Dean
Fausett, Vaughn Flannery, Henry Keller, Richard Lahey, Charles Prendergast,
Boardman Robinson, Iver Rose, Andr&#x00E9;e Ruellan, Henry Schnakenberg, John Sloan,
Katharine Sturgis, Esther Williams, and Mahonri Young. The series also contains
regular letters from Guy P&#x00E8;ne Du Bois, in Europe, that express personal
feelings about his work and recurrent financial problems. Gaston Lachaise was
also a regular correspondent who submitted frequent requests for financial
assistance. After his death his work was handled by his wife, Isabel Nagle
Lachaise, and the series documents the often difficult relations between Isabel
Lachaise and Kraushaar Galleries. Letters from Edith and Ira Glackens
demonstrate the mutual affection and respect between the Glackens family and
the Kraushaars. The series contains only three short letters from Maurice
Prendergast, with one describing his eagerness to exhibit at Kraushaar
Galleries in December 1921, and three short letters from George Luks, which
unfortunately supply little information about his work.</p> 
<p>Correspondence with Gifford Beal, Reynolds Beal, Harriette Miller,
Henry Schnakenberg, and Esther Williams illustrate the depth of the Kraushaar
family's relationship with the Rockport art community, which extended beyond
business to close personal friendships. Throughout the collection there is
evidence that Antoinette Kraushaar continued a tradition of regular vacations
to the area also enjoyed by her father.</p> 
<p>The series contains substantial correspondence from Duncan
Phillips. The descriptions of his enthusiasm for individual artists and
specific pieces provide valuable documentation of his developing tastes.
Regular and lengthy letters from Preston Harrison are full of lively
information about the California art scene. Substantive correspondence with
Elizabeth S. Navas begins in this series and documents the role that Kraushaar
Galleries played in her goal to assemble the Roland P. Murdock Collection of
the Wichita Art Museum under the terms of the will of Navas's friend, Louise
Caldwell Murdock.</p>
<p>Additional incoming correspondence dating from 1901-1944 is found in Series 6.1.</p>
</scopecontent> 

<arrangement><p>Records are arranged chronologically and alphabetically by
correspondent within each year. Nine folders of undated letters can be found at
the beginning of the series. Letters from correspondents whose names are
illegible or not recorded are also placed at the beginning of the appropriate
year. Folders for "Miscellaneous Notes," "Bills," and "Receipts" are filed at
the end of the year to which they relate.</p></arrangement>

<scopecontent> 
<p>This series, which documents the operation of the gallery from
1945 to 1968, is the largest in the collection and rich in artist
correspondence. In addition to correspondence with the artists mentioned in the
description for Series 2, substantial correspondence with Humbert Albrizio,
Bernard Arnest, Peggy Bacon, Louis Bouch&#x00E9;, Leonard DeLonga, Kenneth Evett,
Ernst Halberstadt, Tom Hardy, John Hartell, John Heliker, Robert Laurent, James
Lechay, Carl Morris, James Penney, and Vernon Smith can be found here.</p> 
<p>Correspondence with Eugenie Prendergast, following the death of
Charles Prendergast in 1948, documents the galleries' continued commitment to
the work of the Prendergast brothers and Eugenie Prendergast's decision to end
the business relationship with Kraushaar Galleries around 1961. Substantial
correspondence with Ira Glackens after the death of Edith in 1955 documents the
galleries' continued representation of work by William Glackens. William Dean
Fausett and Vaughn Flannery were both prolific correspondents throughout the
1940s, and their letters provide details concerning many aspects of their work.
The Kraushaars' long and happy association with John Sloan also continues to be
documented here, up to and beyond Sloan's death in 1951. Correspondence from
1947 records Guy P&#x00E8;ne Du Bois's decision to seek another dealer, but that the
split was reasonably amicable is evinced by Antoinette Kraushaar's continued
contact with the family through Du Bois's daughter and artist in her own right,
Yvonne.</p> 
<p>The series documents some strong and mutually beneficial relations
between Kraushaar Galleries and various art institutions and the individuals
responsible for developing their collections. In addition to the institutions
mentioned in the description for Series 1, institutions and individuals that
are particularly well represented include the Toledo Museum of Art, Frederick
Dwight Kirsch and the University of Nebraska Art Department, Alix W. Stanley
and the New Britain Institute, and Ralph L. Wilson and Lehigh University.</p> 
<p>To retain context, there is occasionally some slight overlap
between years in cases where a letter from the end of one year was originally
filed with one from the beginning of the next. Considerable interfiling of
papers with acid-free paper was required in this series as many of the outgoing
letters are printed on highly acidic paper. To reduce the bulk that this
precaution added to the collection, outgoing letters to a single correspondent
were often grouped together; hence strict chronological order has not been
retained.</p>
<p>Additional correspondence dating from 1945-1968 is found in Series 6.1.</p>
</scopecontent>

<arrangement><p>Records are arranged chronologically and alphabetically by
correspondent within each year; folders for "Miscellaneous Notes," "Bills," and
"Receipts" are filed at the end of the year to which they relate. A group of
records dated 1950 to 1951, to and from various correspondents concerning loans
for a William Sommer exhibition at Kraushaar Galleries in 1951, are filed at
the end of 1950. Records for 1965 were not transferred to the Archives of
American Art, with the exception of several pieces of correspondence.
Similarly, there are very few letters from 1968.</p></arrangement>

<p>This series contains 222 undated photographs of works of art
developed by various studios. These photographs are in addition to several
photographs filed with correspondence in Series 1-3. The majority of the images
are identified at least by last name of the artist. The photographs, most of
which depict works of art from the early part of the twentieth century, were
presumably shown to customers and used by Kraushaar Galleries for advertising.</p>
<p>Researchers should note that the bulk of the photographs in this collection are found in Series 6.6.</p>

<unittitle>Correspondence, <unitdate>1877-1981, bulk 1965-1978</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>The bulk of this subseries is mixed incoming and outgoing correspondence dating from 1965-1978.  The earliest correspondence in this collection is also located here, and is comprised primarily of incoming letters from the late 1880s to 1920s. Generally, correspondence is between the gallery and its clients, artists, institutions, and museums, regarding consignments, loans, sales, exhibitions, and other gallery operations. Found is an 1877 letter from William Schaus to Charles Kraushaar.  Also found are two folders of Christmas cards with original artwork from artists Humbert Albrizio, Gifford Reynolds Beal, Werner Drewes, Walter Feldman, Edward Hopper, Andrée Ruellan, Karl Schrag, Linda Sokolowski, and Marguerite Zorach, among others. Additional correspondents found in this subseries include artists Louis Bouché, Leonard DeLonga, Kenneth Evett, Tom Hardy, John Heliker, Robert Laurent, and James Lechay. Researchers should note additional correspondence with artists, especially those represented in the 1970s-2000s, is found in Artists' Files and Consignments and Loans.</p> 

<p>Artists' Christmas cards and miscellaneous correspondence is filed first, followed by correspondence arranged chronologically. Chronological correspondence is filed according to original order upon accession - grouped chronologically in spans of a year and a half (i.e. January 1965 - September 1966), then arranged alphabetically.  There is occasionally some slight overlap between years, generally as a result of interfiled letters from earlier years in order to maintain context.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Bound volumes provide nearly complete financial records for gallery purchases and expenses, transactions, and sales from Kraushaar Galleries' establishment in 1885 until 1947.  Also found is a stock book from 1948-1957 which records sales and costs, and three miscellaneous ledger indices.  Many materials are fragile and where leather rot was present, the covers of the bound volumes were removed.  Folders are arranged alphabetically by type of record, then chronologically.</p>

<unittitle>Consignments and Loans, <unitdate>1899-2006</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>This subseries contains consignment books dating from 1899-1933, and incoming and outgoing consignment and loan records dating from the early 1930s-2000s. Consignment books document the consignee or loanee name, transaction dates, artwork title, artist name, price, and inventory number in ledger books. Incoming consignment records contain account statements to consigners, many of whom were Kraushaar Galleries' artists, inventory and price lists, shipping records, appraisals, notes, and scattered correspondence. Outgoing consignment and loan records are similar to the consignment books, but are on loose ledger pages. There is substantial correspondence with artists James Lechay and Jane Wasey in the incoming consignment materials.</p>

<p>Researchers should use care when using the materials in this subseries; much of the material is on highly acidic paper which has become fragile with friable edges. Consignment books are filed chronologically.  Incoming consignment folders are arranged alphabetically by the artist's or consigner's last name; outgoing records are arranged alphabetically by consignee's name.</p>

<unittitle>Photographic Materials, <unitdate>circa 1920s-2000s, undated</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>The bulk of the photographic materials are loose black and white photographs interspersed with scattered color photographs, negatives, transparencies, Polaroids, digital prints, exhibition catalogs and other printed materials, and one CD-R.  There are also two boxes of negatives which were originally arranged separately, and three oversized albums with black and white photographs by photographer Peter A. Juley of works of art.  Photographs in the albums include catalog numbers and are filed alphabetically by artists' last name.  Images in this subseries are generally of works of art.  Also found are scattered installation views and photographs of artists represented by Kraushaar Galleries from the mid-later years of the twentieth century.</p>  

<p>Folders are arranged alphabetically by type of material, then alphabetically by the artist's last name.  In folders, photographic prints are generally arranged alphabetically by the title of the work of art.</p>
