            <p>Dotty Attie, née Laibow (1938- ), is an American painter and printmaker based in New York City who has been exhibiting in museums and galleries since the 1960s. As a co-founder of Artists in Residence (A.I.R.) Gallery, one of the first all-female cooperative galleries in the United States, Attie has had a considerable impact on the art world prejudices against women artists.</p>
            <p>Born in Pennsauken, New Jersey, Attie pursued her interest in art at the Philadelphia College of Art, and received her BFA in 1959. In 1962, she married the photographer David Attie and they had two children. Throughout the 1960s, Attie continued her education through fellowships at the Brooklyn Museum of Art School and the Art Students League.</p>
            <p>In 1972, Attie and five other women founded A.I.R. Gallery, setting the example of the women's cooperative gallery that would be followed across the country. Attie was a member of A.I.R. Gallery until 1988 and during that time exhibited her own work, curated and co-curated several exhibitions of women artists, organized panels on subjects of interest to women artists, and worked to make the art world more inclusive to women.</p>
            <p>Attie gained national and international recognition through her involvement with A.I.R. Gallery and has received numerous fellowships, grants, residencies, as well as exhibitions in galleries and museums nationally and internationally. Attie has also served as faculty at the Cooper Union and Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
