<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William E. L. Bunn (1910-2009) was a designer, muralist, and painter in Ft. Madison, Iowa and Ojai, California.  Bunn was born in Muscatine, Iowa and received his B.A. in Graphic and Plastic Arts and an M.A. in Theater Design, both from the University of Iowa.  In 1937 he was awarded a one-year post-graduate fellowship as an art intern for Grant Wood.  From 1938 to 1942 he won four commissions from the Treasury Department to produce murals for Federal buildings.  He also exhibited paintings, primarily depicting Mississippi River steamboats, at the National Academy of Design, Art Institute of Chicago, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and other group shows.  Beginning in 1943 Bunn worked as an industrial designer at several companies including Sheaffer Pen Company (1946-1967) and Cuckler Steele Span Company (1967-1977).  After his retirement, he and his wife, Annavene, moved to California, and he continued to paint.   Bunn was also active in the Theosophical Society and had an interest in aviation.</p>

<p>Project files document Bunn's work as a painter and muralist.  Bunn created a notebook "Index to Projects" late in his career.  Each project, including his post office mural projects, was assigned a number and has a one page description and photograph within the notebook. Also found is a corresponding file for each of the projects from the index.  Files may include photographs, notes, and sketches.  Files on the post office mural projects are extensive and may also include correspondence, news clippings, and related publications.  Researchers should note that additional drawings for these projects may be found in Series 10: Artwork.

<p>Personal photographs include snapshots and portraits of Bunn, photographs of his wife, Annavene, and children, Cheri and Eric.  Also found are numerous photographs of family and friends, including two family photograph albums.  Many of these photographs are unidentified.  Photographs also depict artwork by Bunn, however, researchers should note that additional photographs of artwork are included among the project files in Series 3.  Additional photographs depict various subjects that were of interest to Bunn and may have been used as references for his artwork, including nature scenes, steamboats, airplanes, and bridges.</p>

<p>Artwork primarily consists of pencil drawings, watercolors, and pastels.  Found here are costume and theater designs created as part of William Bunn's thesis at University of Iowa.  Also included are drawings and watercolors for potential art projects. Researchers should note that many of the miscellaneous drawings here were most likely preliminary drawings and studies for works documented in Series 3: Project Files or technical drawings from his work as an industrial designer.  Drawings frequently depict steamboats, airplanes, people, and mechanical designs. Additionally, there are four sketchbooks.  Two of these sketchbooks contain sketches and notes for the post office murals in Minden, Nebraska, and Hamburg, Iowa. </p>
