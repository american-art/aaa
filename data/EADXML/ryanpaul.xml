            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Paul Ryan was a pioneering video artist, writer, teacher, and theoretician based in New York City and the Hudson Valley of New York State. Born in 1943, Ryan spent his early adulthood as a seminarian and later a member of the Roman Catholic order of Passionist monks, which he left in 1965. He eventually received a B.A. from New York University. During the Vietnam War, Ryan received conscientious objector status and studied with Marshall McLuhan at Fordham University as alternative service. It was McLuhan's influence that led Ryan to begin to explore the possibilities of the medium of video.</p>
            <p>In 1969, Ryan participated in the landmark exhibition "TV as a Creative Medium" curated by Howard Wise, which served to link the kinetic art movement of the 1960s with the emergent medium of video art. The first exhibition in the United States devoted to video, "TV as a Creative Medium" signaled radical changes and defined an emerging artistic movement. In 1969 Ryan co-founded the Raindance Corporation along with Ira Schneider, Michael Shamberg, David Cort, Beryl Korot, Phyllis Gershuny, and others. Raindance was an influential media collective that proposed radical theories and philosophies of video as an alternative form of cultural communication. Influenced by the communications theories of Marshall McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller, the collective produced tapes and writings that explored the relation of cybernetics, media, and ecology. From 1970-1974, Raindance published the seminal video journal 
                <title render="italic">Radical Software</title>, which provided a network of communications for the fledgling alternative video movement. In 1971, Shamberg published 
                <title render="italic">Guerrilla Television</title>, a summary of the group's principles and a blueprint for a decentralization of television through access to public and cable programming. The original Raindance collective dispersed in the mid-1970s; the nonprofit Raindance Foundation continued into the 1990s. Ryan's core writings from the Raindance era were gathered into his 1973 publication 
                <title render="italic">Birth and Death and Cybernation</title>, republished in 1974 as 
                <title render="italic">Cybernetics of the Sacred</title>.</p>
            <p>Ryan's work to develop alternative uses of video technology continued long after his involvement with Raindance. He began to implement his theories about the use of video monitoring and feedback within dynamic systems with the work that came to be known as the Earthscore Notational System. With Steve Kolpan and Bob Schuler, he founded the Earthscore Foundation, through which he raised money for the exploration and development of this applied practice. Earthscore, based largely on the writings of philosopher Charles Sanders Pierce and Gregory Bateson's work on cybernetics, provided the theoretical and logical underpinnings of both the ecosystem documentation and interpretation process, and the triadic rituals of interpersonal behavior, that became the core of Ryan's work for much of his life. These ideas were implemented in a wide variety of projects such as eco-channel design, video scores specific to certain locations, threeing projects exploring interpersonal behavior with video and computer technology, and a curriculum for combining media production training with environmental education.</p>
            <p>Ryan later worked with organizations such as Talking Wood, The Earth Environmental Group, and Environment '89, (re-named in later years Environment '90, '91, and '92) to implement Earthscore systems and prototypes. He co-founded The Gaia Institute, hosted at Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and co-directed it from 1985-1991. The Institute fostered dialogs between science, religion, and art through workshops, lectures, exhibitions and events. He was an artist-in-residence for Earth Environmental Group in 1988 via a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, and used the residency to carry out his video project "Nature in New York City," documenting city ecosystems and demonstrating how an eco-channel might work. Environment '89 organized a coordinated campaign for a cable channel devoted to the environment, the New York City Eco-channel for a Sustainable Tomorrow (NEST).</p>
            <p>Ryan spent his later years as a professor of media production and theory at Savannah College of Art and Design, and then at the New School for Social Research. His work has been exhibited widely in the United States, including "The Primitivism Show" in The Museum of Modern Art (1984), "The American Century Show" at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1999-2000), and the Venice Biennale (2002). He died in 2013.</p>

            <p>The Paul Ryan papers measure 19.7 linear feet and document Ryan's education and career as a pioneering video artist, theorist, writer, and educator. Records include school records, family papers, correspondence, writings, project files, video recordings, teaching files, printed materials, scattered photographs, and artwork by others. Organizational records are also found for the Earthscore Foundation, Earth Environmental Group, the Gaia Institute, and the Raindance Corporation, among others. The bulk of Ryan's professional work is documented in his writings and project files.</p>
            <p>Biographical materials include family papers, early correspondence among Ryan family members, school records, selective service records, photographs of Paul Ryan, and career documentation such as résumés, CVs, recommendation letters, and narratives written by Ryan describing his career. Records related to Ryan's time in the seminary and monastery include letters home during this period, and his letter of resignation from 1965.</p>
            <p>Correspondence is mainly professional in nature, and spans Ryan's career. Correspondence between Ryan and family members is also found. Professional correspondence is found with Myrdene Anderson, Peter Berg of Planet Drum, Morris Berman, Avery Johnson, Marga Bijvoet, Thomas Berry, Lois Bianchi, David Dunn, Roberta Kevelson, Gerrit Lansing, Aldo Lira, Oliver Lowenstein, Chip Lord, Claude Ponsol, Jody Procter, Jodi Sibert, Phyllis Gershuny Segura, Michael Shamberg, and Marita Sturken. Corporate correspondence is found regarding job applications, manuscript submissions to publishers, and video submissions to museums and broadcasters.</p>
            <p>Writings include mainly articles and notebooks by Ryan, but also drafts of books, lectures, poetry, short stories, a treatment for a television show, and writings by others in various genres. Most of Ryan's prose writing is theoretical in nature, although personal writings and notes from projects are also found. Articles include both published and unpublished writings, with some published multiple times under different titles. Over one hundred notebooks spanning forty years contain a variety of content including drafts of letters, articles, grant proposals, lectures, and other writings. Ryan's two major publications, 
                <title render="italic">Cybernetics of the Sacred</title> and 
                <title render="italic">Video Mind, Earth Mind</title>, are documented with drafts, contracts, correspondence with publishers, layout documents, and notes.</p>
            <p>Organizational records include writings, correspondence, printed material, financial records, grant proposals, and other records concerning various organizations, collectives, and companies in which Ryan participated, mostly having to do with environmental advocacy, video production, or a combination of the two. Organizations with substantial records in this series include the Earth Environmental Group, the Earthscore Foundation, Environment '89 (and '90, '91, and '92), the Gaia Institute, and the Raindance Corporation, among others. Documentation is most comprehensive for The Earthscore Foundation, including by-laws, grant proposals, extensive writings, financial records, and printed materials.</p>
            <p>Project files contain video recordings, production notes, photographs, proposals, correspondence, a computer program designed by Ryan, prints for exhibition, illustrations and designs, posters, circulars, contracts, and scripts. Many of the projects documented in this series relate to Ryan's many explorations of the use of video to monitor and interpret two seemingly different subjects, environmental change and human behavior in relationships, expressed through a ritual of interaction among three persons designed by Ryan and called "Threeing," or "Triadic Behavior." The most thoroughly documented projects in this series include "Nature in New York City," "New York City Eco-Channel for Sustainable Television (NEST)," 
                <title render="italic">Talking Wood</title> (a publication that incorporated the project "Watershed Watch"), "Inventing Triadic Behavior" (also known as the "Triadic Tapes"), "Tethys"(with artist Bob Schuler), and "Video Wake for my Father," a performance for video that saw many iterations, including a private performance, a public performance, an edited video program, and a published script.</p>
            <p>Video recordings are found for three projects, including "Nature in New York City," "Inventing Triadic Behavior," and a threeing workshop held at the Kitchen entitled "Video Variations on Holy Week." A printout of records in a videotape database kept by Ryan is found in this series, with a proposal for video preservation; the list of tapes includes those found in the collection as well as tapes not extant.</p>
            <p>Teaching files include documentation of Ryan's work at Dalton School, Hudson School, the New School for Social Research, and Savannah College of Art and Design, and many other workshops and training programs Ryan taught. Included are grade books, correspondence, curricula, training materials, and reports. Two of his programs, the Black Rock Rangers at the Dalton School, and the Urban Conservation Corps Pilot Video Program involve the implementation of the Earthscore Notational System in school curricula.</p>
            <p>Printed material includes books, newspaper clippings, conference programs and published proceedings, exhibition catalogs and announcements, film and video programs, flyers, periodicals, poetry publications, posters, and materials relating to the artist Al Robbins, which includes an obituary written by Ryan. Also found are publications of the Raindance Corporation, which include the book, 
                <title render="italic">Guerrilla Television</title> (1971), and four issues of their magazine, 
                <title render="italic">Radical Software</title> (1971-1972). Most of the printed material was either written by Paul Ryan, contains articles by Paul Ryan, or documents activities of Paul Ryan. Other materials found contain works by Ryan's associates and collaborators.</p>
            <p>Artwork contains artists' books, doodles, illustrations, prints, and photographs by named and unnamed artists. None of the artwork in this series appears to be by Ryan. Notable is an artist's book entitled "Patterns" by Lida Zerella, which incorporates still images from Ryan's Triadic Tapes in a small album. Two illustrations are found by Claude Ponsot, who also illustrated many of Ryan's publications relating to Kleinform and threeing.</p>

Letters signed only with first names, unsigned, and illegibly signed letters are filed at the end of the series.</p>

                    <p>Writings are arranged by type of material. Most of the writings are arranged alphabetically by title if one exists, or by subject matter if no title is given. Notebooks were processed to a minimal level and arranged chronologically. Notebooks containing notes relating to a single project or work are filed with that project or work. Those filed in this series have heterogeneous content and cover a range of subjects. Note cards and loose notes were sorted loosely by subject during processing.</p>
                    <p>Significant additional writings are also found in series 5, Project Files, in the form of project documentation and proposals. Writings in published form are found in series 7, Printed Material. A lengthy script and drafts of the project "Video Wake for my Father" by Ryan is found in Series 5.3 Other Projects. Writings and other records related to Earthscore are found in series 4, Organizational Records.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Writings include mainly articles, lectures, book drafts, and notebooks by Ryan. Also found are poetry, short stories, a treatment for a television show, and writings by others in various genres. Most of Ryan's prose writing is theoretical in nature, although personal writings and notes from projects are also found. His core ideas are found in multiple forms, re-worked and revised for new publications and new applications. Articles include both published and unpublished writings, with some published multiple times under different titles. Some of the writings filed under articles are short essays in draft form which may have been incorporated into other works. Several of the articles were later collected in books. Books are documented with multiple drafts of 
                        <title render="italic">Cybernetics of the Sacred</title> and 
                        <title render="italic">Video Mind, Earth Mind</title>, as well as contracts and correspondence with publishers, layout documents, and notes. The article "Art and Survival: The Earthscore Notational System" brings together many of Ryan's core theories and ideas about their implementation.</p>
                    <p>Notebooks include over 100 notebooks spanning 40 years, and are arranged chronologically. Many notebooks contain notes related to later published works or projects, and such notes can be located by the date of the work. Notebooks in this series typically cover many subjects or do not relate in an obvious way to a single project. Some of the early notebooks have a subject written by Ryan on their cover, and where this is the case it has been included in the container listing. Some of the early notebooks are more like journals, and others contain journal entries along with drafts of letters, articles, or project notes.</p>

                    <p>Organizational records include writings, correspondence, printed material, financial records, grant proposals, and other records concerning various organizations, collectives, and companies in which Ryan participated, mostly having to do with environmental advocacy, video production, or a combination of the two. Organizations with substantial records in this series include the Earth Environmental Group, the Earthscore Foundation, Environment '89 (and '90, '91, and '92), the Gaia Institute, Raindance Corporation, Responsive Environments Corporation, and Space Videoarts.</p>
                    <p>Documentation of the organization the Earthscore Foundation includes financial records, by-laws, writings, grant proposals, and printed material. Writings outline Ryan's Earthscore Notational System, among other projects. Grant proposals also contain significant description of the organization's projects. Gaia Institute records include mainly writings and notes, including a proposal for a conference series, "Professionals for the Earth."</p>
                    <p>Raindance Corporation records include a partial transcript of a 1970 interview with Ryan, excerpts of which appeared in the 2nd issue of 
                        <title render="italic">Radical Software</title> magazine, an essay about the video "Supermarket," flyers, lists of Raindance video productions, and exhibition announcements from a 1991 retrospective at the Whitney museum. A single contact sheet is unlabeled but contains photographs of Ryan, Buckminster Fuller, and possibly David Cort and Ira Schneider.</p>
                    <p>Responsive Environments Corporation records contain notes and writings produced by Ryan on potential commercial and educational uses for video, written in 1968 and 1969. Space Videoarts records include correspondence, financial records, grant proposals for start up funding, and a proposal for an ecological cable channel written by Ryan which is an early iteration of his work on what he later called eco-channel design.</p>

                    <p>This series includes documentation of projects Ryan carried out or participated in, including video productions, performances, conferences, art projects, and publications.</p>
                    <p>Many of the projects documented in this series reflect Ryan's explorations of the use of video to monitor and interpret two seemingly different subjects, environmental change and human behavior in relationships, explored through a routine invented by Ryan called triadic behavior, or threeing. Other projects document early explorations of the use of video, mainly "Video Wake for my Father," a performance for video that saw many iterations, including a private performance, a public performance, an edited video program, and a published script.</p>
                    <p>The series includes 47 videocassettes (U-Matic) out of the hundreds of video recordings created by Ryan. A printout of the database Ryan kept of his video recordings is available in series 5.3: Other Projects, under the heading "Video Preservation." Tape numbers listed in the container list for this series refer to numbers assigned in that database and on the tapes themselves.</p>

                        <p>Series includes documentation from Ryan's environmentally-focused projects including "Nature in New York City," "New York City Eco-channel for a Sustainable Tomorrow (NEST)," the publication 
                            <title render="italic">Talking Wood</title>, the video project Tapping on Water, other unidentified projects involving the Earthscore Notational System, and many proposals for similar projects.</p>
                        <p>Video recordings found in this series for "Nature in New York City," all U-matic videocassettes, include nine camera original videocassettes documenting the Bronx River waterfall, one videocassette documenting views of NYC shot from the World Trade Center, and one videocassette containing an early edited version of the piece. Notebooks for this project contain shotlists for video shot at Staten Island Clay Pit Ponds State Park, the Bronx River waterfall, the World Trade Center tapes, and saplings at Inwood Hill Park in Manhattan.</p>
                        <p>Although most of the other environmental projects documented in this series involved the use of video, apart from "Nature in New York City," their documentation does not include video recordings. Records for NEST include correspondence, notes, a petition, and other records documenting an advocacy movement to dedicate a cable access channel to the environment. Records for 
                            <title render="italic">Talking Wood</title> include notes and photographs used in the publication. Tapping on Water is documented with a proposal, an artist statement, and a shotlist.</p>

                        <p>Ryan's work on the use of video to create a self-correcting system of relationships through scored routines of interactions are referred to throughout the collection as "triadic behavior," "relational practice," or "threeing." This series includes documentation from projects related to threeing such as the Triadic Tapes (aka "Inventing Triadic Behavior"), the Circuit, which is courseware for implementing threeing concepts into education, the Consensus computer program, the ICM method, the Behavior Invention Marathon, the Tricultural Tournament, the Hall of Risk, exhibited at the 2002 Venice Biennale, and many others.</p>
                        <p>Also found are records related to threeing in general and not a specific project, such as notes and flyers for workshops or demonstrations. Kleinform illustrations include sketches, finished drawings, and Photostats of a visual element of threeing exercises. Several of these illustrations were created by Claude Ponsot and published in Ryan's writings about Triadic behavior. The threeing rug design project was in part a collaboration with the artist Michael Kalil. Sketches and diagrams documenting the project contain a variety of media, from quick pencil sketches to color prints.</p>
                        <p>Also found are 35 videocassettes (U-matic) referred to throughout Ryan's papers as the Triadic Tapes, aka Inventing Triadic Behavior, which document extensive early threeing experiments with dancers at the Ashokan Field Campus of the State University of New York at New Paltz. An additional video recording is found with records for the "Video Variations on Holy Week" workshop on triadic behavior at the Kitchen. Records from the Empowerment Center Retreat include still photographs of Ryan's threeing ritual.</p>

                        <p>Other projects include performances, freelance jobs, and art projects. Contracts and agreements include a loan agreement with Ira Schneider of Raindance for video equipment borrowed from Ryan in 1969. Ryan's research on video uses and equipment include correspondence, notes, and brochures for video equipment.</p>
                        <p>Tethys was an environmental artwork by Bob Schuler involving a round-the-world sea voyage on which Ryan traveled. His project documenting the journey is referred to in his records as "What the Camera Conceals." Tethys files include photographs of Ryan, Schuler, and crew, as well as proposals and notes on Ryan's video production. "Video Wake for My Father" was a project that spanned nearly twenty years, beginning as a taped private performance, then becoming a video and public performance, and later a published play accompanied by poetry by Ryan's brother, Jim Ryan. One sound cassette of Ryan reading the piece is also found.</p>
                        <p>Among the proposals in this series is a long essay reflecting on Ryan's stint as the first reviewer of grant proposals to the New York State Council on the Arts in the field of video during the 1970s. Another proposal concerns the preservation of his video recordings, which includes a printed report from a database of hundreds of tapes shot by Ryan, including all the tapes in this collection.</p>

                    <p>Series contains contracts, syllabi, course descriptions, teacher evaluations, workshop descriptions, notes in development of courses, grant proposal for course development, student work, correspondence related to academic job hunting. Records in this series relate to teaching jobs Ryan held at The Hudson School, the Dalton School, Ramapo College, and Savannah college of Art and Design, as well as teaching projects and workshops supported by various organizations and government agencies. Course subjects include media, communications, video production, environment, theory, semiotics, and the Earthscore system applied in various educational contexts. Multiple curricula are found combining video production training with environmental education, particularly the Black Rock Rangers at Dalton School, and the Urban Conservation Corps Video Pilot Program.</p>
