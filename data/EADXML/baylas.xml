<bioghist altrender="biography" encodinganalog="545" id="a2">
<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Abraham Solomon Baylinson was born on January 6, 1882 in Moscow, Russia.  His family immigrated to the United States in about 1900, and Baylinson eventually became interested in art and studied at the Art Students League, the National Academy of Design, and with Robert Henri and Homer Boss.</p>

<p>Baylinson was long affiliated with the Society of Independent Artists of which he was secretary from 1918-1934.  He was also an instructor of painting and drawing at the Art Students League from 1931 to 1933.</p>

<p>Early in 1931, a fire destroyed almost 20 years of Baylinson's art work.  When he resumed painting, his style had evolved into a more representational one.</p>

<p>Baylinson's work has been exhibited at the Detroit Institute of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, and at the National Gallery of Canada.</p>

<p>A. S. Baylinson died in May 1950 in New York City.</p>
