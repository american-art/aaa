<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Abstract Expressionist painter, sculptor, and writer Cleve Gray (1918-2004) lived and worked in Connecticut where he was politically active in the Vietnam protest movement and other liberal causes.</p><p>

Born Cleve Ginsberg in New York City (the family changed its name to Gray in 1936), he attended the Ethical Culture School and at a young age developed a fascination with color and paint. At the urging of friends, Cleve's parents allowed him to accompany a school friend for lessons with George Bellows' student Antonia Nell. She encouraged and inspired the young artist, and a still life he painted in her class was shown at the National Academy of Design's 1932 annual exhibition. Miss Nell also introduced him to Louise N. Grace, an artist who became a good friend and had a lasting influence on him. While a student at Phillips Academy, Cleve studied painting with Bartlett Hayes and aspired to paint in France. Upon his graduation in 1936, he was awarded the Samuel F. B. Morse Prize for most promising art student. </p><p>

Gray's mother was always supportive of his career choice. His businessman father, who didn't understand his son's desire to be an artist, insisted on a college education. Cleve chose Princeton, where he majored in art and archaeology, and studied painting with James E. Davis. His senior thesis was on Chinese landscape painting; both Eastern philosophy and art were long-term influences on Gray's work and outlook. He graduated summa cum laude in 1940, and then spent several months painting while living at the farm of a family friend in Mendham, New Jersey.</p><p>

When a doctor suggeted that a dry climate might relieve sinus and asthma problems, Gray moved to Tucson, Arizona. Once settled in the desert, he contacted Louise N. Grace, whom he had met as a young teenager through his art instructor. Miss Grace, an artist and daughter of the founder of W. R. Grace and Co., was a highly cultured and independent woman older than his parents. The summer before Gray entered Phillips Academy, she had hired him to brush ground color onto canvases for murals she was painting for "Eleven Arches," her home in Tuscon then under construction. Miss Grace invited Gray to visit "Eleven Arches" to see the completed murals, and despite the substantial age difference, their friendship deepened; Gray found in her intellectual and spiritual guidance that was lacking in his own family. He remained in Tucson until enlisting in the U. S. Army in 1942, and they corresponded frequently during the the war. When a stroke in 1948 prevented Miss Grace from participating in the extensive tour of Europe she was arranging for a small group of friends, including Gray, she provided sufficient funds and insisted he make the trip on his own. Another stroke, suffered while Gray was traveling, left her in a coma; he was not permitted to see her again. Upon her death in 1954, Gray inherited "Eleven Arches."  </p><p>

Between 1943 and 1946, Gray was stationed in England, France, and Germany, serving in Army Signal Intelligence. Most of his work was performed at night, and he spent his free time drawing. While in London, Gray produced many colored pencil drawings of buildings that had been bombed. In France, a Red Cross volunteered to introduce him to Jacques Villon; although unfamiliar with the artist, Gray knew of Villon's brother, Marcel Duchamp, and accepted the invitation. Jacques and Gaby Villon lived near Gray's billet and he became a frequent visitor. Their friendship was important to his development as an artist. After being discharged from the Army in 1946, Gray remained in France to work with Villon who introduced him to the study of color and the concept of intellectual quality in painting. Gray also studied informally with André Lhote, Villon's former teacher. "American Painters in Paris," an exhibition presented in 1946 at Galerie Durand-Ruel, included work by Cleve Gray. </p><p> 

He returned to New York City in 1946. In the tight post-war rental market Gray managed to find a small room upstairs from a grocery store on East 106th Street for use as a studio. He commenced painting the <emph render="italic">London Ruins</emph> series based on drawings he had made during the war, and began thinking about exhibiting in New York. Gray secured introductions to Pierre Matisse, Curt Valentin, and Dorothy Miller. They encouraged him, but no opportunities came his way until Germain Seligmann, whose gallery was expanding its scope to include contemporary art, followed the advice of Curt Valentin and looked at Gray's work. Gary's first solo exhibition, held at Jacques Seligmann and Co.,  included selections from the <emph render="italic">London Ruins</emph> series, paintings done in Maine and Arizona, and a few portraits. <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph> called it "an auspicious first," and one of the <emph render="italic">London Ruins</emph> series was selected by Edward Alden Jewell for the "Critic's Exhibition" at Grand Central Gallery. </p><p> 

Gray found New York City too frenetic. In 1949 he bought a large, old house in Warren, Connecticut, and lived and worked at "Graystones" for the remainder of his life. Half of a 6-car garage was converted to a studio; many years later, his studio moved to a barn, its renovation and design planned by sculptor and architect Tony Smith.</p><p>

He married Francine du Plessix in 1957. Always interested in literature and philosophy, in the 1960s Francine du Plessix Gray began contributing articles to <emph render="italic">The New Yorker</emph> and is still affiliated with the magazine. Her reviews and articles appeared in prominent publications, and she wrote several award-winning novels and biographies. Their sons, Thaddeus and Luke (now a painter), were born in 1959 and 1961. Francine's mother, Tatiana du Plessix (the hat designer Tatiana of Saks), and step-father, the sculptor Alexander Liberman (also former art director of <emph render="italic">Vogue</emph> and later editorial director of Condé Nast publications) became Cleve Gray's closest friends.</p><p> 

The paintings and drawings of Cleve Gray - first consisting of figures and portraits, and then abstract compositions - were often produced in series. The earliest series, <emph render="italic">London Ruins</emph>, grew from the colored pencil drawings made while stationed in London during World War II. Travels to France, Italy, Greece, Morocco, Hawaii, Spain, Egypt, Japan, and Czechoslovakia, inspired many series, among them:  <emph render="italic">Etruscan</emph>, <emph render="italic">Augury</emph>, <emph render="italic">Ceres</emph>, <emph render="italic">Demeter Landscape</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hera</emph>, <emph render="italic">Morocco</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hawaii</emph>, <emph render="italic">Ramses</emph>, <emph render="italic">Perne</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hatshepsut</emph>, <emph render="italic">Roman Walls</emph>, <emph render="italic">Zen</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Prague</emph>. His hometown, the Holocaust, and musicians inspired other series: <emph render="italic">Warren</emph>, <emph render="italic">Sleepers Awake!</emph>, <emph render="italic">Bela Bartok</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Four Heads of Anton Bruckner</emph>. Some series were works on paper, others were collage canvases, and a few series later spawned prints. Gray began using acrylics in the 1940s. Although the medium offered many benefits, he did not always like its appearance and frequently returned to oils. Around 1966 Gray was painting almost exclusively with acrylic, and eventually developed a technique of thinning the paint and applying successive layers of color (sometimes by pouring or with a sponge) on cotton duck rather than traditional canvas.  </p><p>
	
Gray was attracted to sculpture, too, working in that medium at different points in his career. His first sculpture, in plaster, was completed in 1959. In the early 1960s he visited a commercial sand-casting foundry and became excited about learning to cast in bronze. He made about a dozen sculptures to cast in sand, but due to too much undercutting, their casting became too difficult a problem. Lava flows seen while in Hawaii during 1970 and 1971 inspired a return to sculpture. This time, he used wood, papier maché, and metal. Gray then decided these pieces should be cast in bronze, and he was determined to do it himself.  Friends taught him the lost wax process and he began working at the Tallix Foundry in Peekskill, New York where, over the next year, he cast about forty bronzes.</p><p>  

Gray's best known work is <emph render="italic">Threnody</emph>, a lament for the dead of both sides in Vietnam. In 1972, Gray received a commission to fill a very large gallery of the soon-to-open Neuberger Museum of Art (State University of New York, College at Purchase)  designed by Philip Johnson. Friends of the Neuberger Museum paid his expenses and Gray, who was enormously excited about the project he considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, donated his time. Developing plans for the execution of <emph render="italic">Threnody</emph> consumed most of his time during 1972 and 1973. Composed of a series of fourteen panels, each approximately twenty feet square, the piece presented a number of technical challenges. It was constructed and painted in situ during the summer and early fall of 1973. Since then, <emph render="italic">Threnody</emph> has been reinstalled at the Neuberger Museum of Art on several occasions. </p><p> 

Gray was commissioned to design liturgical vestments for two Episcopal churches in Connecticut in the 1970s. A chasuble, stoles, and a mitre were commissioned by the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut in 1984.</p><p>

He won the "Outdoor Art at the Station Competition," for Union Station, Hartford, Connecticut. His very large porcelain enamel tile mural, <emph render="italic">Movement in Space</emph>, was installed on the façade of the transportation center in 1988.  </p><p>

Gray began writing occasional articles and exhibition reviews in the late 1940s. His concern with rational structure in art led him to question Abstract Expressionism and write "Narcissus in Chaos." This article, published in 1959 by <emph render="italic">The American Scholar</emph>, drew considerable attention. In 1960, <emph render="italic">Cosmopolitan</emph> published "Women - Leaders of Modern Art" that featured Nell Blaine, Joan Brown, Elaine de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Sonia Gretchoff, Grace Hartigan, Ethel Magafan, Louise Nevelson, and Georgia O'Keefe. Between 1960 and 1970, Gray was a contributing editor of <emph render="italic">Art In America</emph>, producing numerous articles (a few co-authored with Francine) and reviews for the periodical. He edited three books, <emph render="italic">David Smith by David Smith: Scupture and Writings</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hans Richter</emph>, and <emph render="italic">John Marin</emph>, all published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, and translated Marcel Duchamp's <emph render="italic">A l'Infinitif.</emph></p><p>

During the early 1960s, Gray became intensely focused on the situation in Vietnam. His first artistic response came in 1963 with <emph render="italic">Reverend Quan Duc</emph>, painted to commemorate a Buddhist monk who had immolated himself. Francine, too, felt strongly about the issue and over time the couple became increasingly active in the anti-war movement. They joined a number of organizations and helped to found a local chapter of Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam. The years 1968 and 1969 were an especially intense and active period for the Grays. They protested, wrote and spoke out against the war, raised funds to support anti-war political candidates, and on a few occasions were arrested and jailed. Writing for <emph render="italic">Art in America</emph>, editing the book series, and anti-war activities left little time for his art. In 1970 Gray refocused his attention on painting.</p><p>   

Beginning in 1947, Gray was always represented by a New York Gallery: Jacques Seligmann and Co. (1947-1959), Staempfli Gallery (1960-1965), Saidenberg Gallery (1965-1968), Betty Parsons Gallery (1968-1983), Armstrong Gallery (1984-1987), and Berry-Hill Galleries (1988-2003). He was represented by galleries in other cities, as well, but not as consistently or for such long periods.</p><p>

He exhibited extensively in group and solo exhibitions throughout the United States and internationally. In addition to numerous solo exhibitions presented by the dealers who represented Gray, there were retrospective exhibitions at: Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Brooklyn Museum, Columbus Museum of Art, Krannert Art Museum (University of Illinois, Champaign), Princeton University Art Museum, Rhode Island School of Design, and Wadsworth Atheneum.</p><p> 

Many museums' permanent collections include the work of Cleve Gray, among them: Albright-Knox Art Gallery,  Butler Institute of American Art, Columbus Museum of Art, Neuberger Museum of Art (SUNY, College at Purchase), the Museum of Modern Art (New York), Newark Museum, Oklahoma City Museum of Art, Phillips Collection, Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery (University of Nebraska, Lincoln), Smithsonian Institution, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Yale University Art Gallery.</p><p>

Cleve Gray served as artist-in-residence at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art in 1963 and at the Honolulu Academy of Arts in 1970, both sponsored by Ford Foundation programs. In 1980, he was appointed an artist-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome, where Francine concurrently served as a writer-in-residence; they returned for shorter periods during each of the subsequent seven years. Cleve Gray was presented the Connecticut Arts Award in 1987, and the Neuberger Museum of Art Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Hartford in 1992, and was elected a member of The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1998. In addition, he was a trustee of the Neuberger Museum of Art, New York Studio School, Rhode Island School of Design, and Wadsworth Atheneum.</p><p> 

Cleve Gray hit his head and suffered a massive subdural hematoma after falling on ice outside of his home. He died the following day, December 8, 2004.</p></bioghist>

<p>This series consists of manuscripts and drafts, research materials, notes, and miscellaneous writings. Writings by Cleve Gray on a wide range of art-related topics include articles, catalog introductions and reviews.

<p>Among the writings by other authors are pieces about Cleve Gray including the manuscript of <emph render="italic">Cleve Gray</emph> by Nicholas Fox Weber and records concerning three books edited by Gray, <emph render="italic">David Smith by David Smith: Sculpture and Writings</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hans Richter</emph>, and <emph render="italic">John Marin</emph>. Research material survives for the next volume in the series, <emph render="italic">Naum Gabo</emph>, which was never published. Also included are notes relating to Cleve Gray's translation of <emph render="italic">A l'Iinfinitif</emph> by Marcel Duchamp.</p>

<p>Also found is a small volume of notes and reminiscences about Jackson Pollock by an unidentified author. </p></scopecontent>

<arrangement><p>A small number of miscellaneous writings by Gray and others are scattered throughout the alphabetical files (Series 2).

<p>Writings about Gray include a biography, <emph render="italic">Cleve Gray</emph>, by Nicholas Fox Weber, and manuscripts of a poem, student paper, and reviews.</p> 
<p>A significant portion of this subseries is comprised of manuscripts, drafts, notes, and research materials for three books edited by Cleve Gray, <emph render="italic">David Smith by David Smith: Sculpture and Writings</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hans Richter</emph>, and <emph render="italic">John Marin</emph>. Published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc. between 1968 and 1973, each volume features selected writings by the artist about his work and life, along with photogrphs. Research material survives for the next volume in the series, <emph render="italic">Naum Gabo</emph>, which was never published. Gray discontinued the series when Gabo abruptly changed his mind just as the manuscript was nearly completed. This subseries also contains notes concerning Gray's translation of <emph render="italic">A L'Infinitif</emph> by Marcel Duchamp.</p> 
<p>Also found is "The Resurrection in Art," a lecture by Jane Daggett Dillenberger. Among the items by unknown authors is a small volume containing notes and reminiscences of Jackson Pollock.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Photographs are of artwork, events, people, places, and miscellaneous subjects. Also found with this series are photographs used to illustrate <emph render="italic">David Smith by David Smith: Sculpture and Writings</emph>, and a small number of negatives and color transparencies.</p>

<p>Most of the artwork appearing in the photographs is by Cleve Gray and consists of drawings, paintings, and sculpture arranged by medium. Among them are destroyed paintings, and an original print of <emph render="italic">Photo Abstraction</emph> by Gray, circa 1934.  Of particular note are photographs of preparatory drawings for <emph render="italic">Threnody</emph>, the work in progress, and completed panels. Other artists represented are: Louise N. Grace, Jacques Lipchitz, John Marin, Hans Richter, and Jacques Villon. </p> 				

<p>Photographs of people are mainly portraits of Gray, and views of him with Francine and their family. Among these are one of the family with their infant son, Thaddeus, by Irving Penn; a portrait of Gray at about age three (a modern copy print); and other portraits of him by Cornelia Lavin, Alexander Liberman, Frances McLaughlin-Gill, and Nancy Tutko. Other individuals pictured are Hans Richter and some of his descendants. Photographs of places consist of Gray's studio.</p>
<p>Events are an unidentified exhibition opening and miscellaneous subjects are exhibition installations.</p>
