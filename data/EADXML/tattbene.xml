<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Benedict Tatti (1917-1993) worked in New York as a sculptor, painter, educator, and video artist.</p>
<p>Born in New York in 1917, Tatti began his art education at Haaren High School. He continued his studies at the Roerich Museum with Louis Slobodkin, the Art Students League with William Zorach and Ossip Zadkine, and the Leonardo da Vinci School of Art under Attillio Piccirelli. Later in his career, he attended the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts.  During World War II, Tatti served in the United States Army Air Force, where he spent three years assigned to variety of projects.  In 1948, Benedict Tatti married Adele Rosenberg in New York City. </p>
<p>Throughout his career, Tatti continuously experimented with various media.  From 1952-1963, Tatti executed sculptural models of architectural and consumer products for the industrial designers, Raymond Loewy Associates; later he became a color consultant for the firm.  In the 1960s, influenced by the Abstract Expressionists, Tatti turned from carving directly in wood and stone to creating assemblage sculptures, using bronze metal and other industrial materials.  During this period, Tatti spent summers on Monhegan Island in Maine, where he developed his water coloring techniques.  In 1963, Tatti was hired to teach sculpture at the High School of Art and Design in New York, a position that he held for fifteen years.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Tatti, with no previous background in video work developed technology for video imaging. He became an associate member of the Kitchen at the Mercer Arts Center exhibiting his video sculptures along with other early innovators of this new art form.  In 1975, he invented a rewind reel adapter device.  Despite health problems, Tatti continued to work and exhibit into the 1980s.  He assisted his brother, Alexander Tatti and his nephew, Steven Tatti on the restoration of the Statue of Liberty on Ellis Island, which was completed in 1985.</p>
<p>Benedict Tatti received solo and group exhibitions at museums and galleries in the United States and abroad, including the Burr Gallery, Claude Bernard Galleries, Metropolitan Museum of Art, under the Artists for Victory Program, Museum of Modern Art, National Gallery of Art, Northeast Gallery, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Roko Gallery.  Also, Tatti's
work was regularly featured in annual exhibitions of several arts organizations:       
American Society of Contemporary Artists, Annual Avant Garde Festival, Audubon Artists, Brooklyn Society of Artists, and Painters and Sculptors Society of New Jersey. His awards included the National Soldier Art Competition at the National Gallery of Art (1945); Artist-in-Residence, National Center of Experiments TV, San Francisco, California, (1969); and the Creative Artists Public Service (CAPS), (1972).  Tatti's artwork is in the permanent collections of the American Numismatic Society, Art Students League, Dumbarton Oaks, Monhegan Museum, Smithsonian Institution, and  the Usdan Center for the Creative and Performing Arts.  </p>
<p>Benedict Tatti died on July 30, 1993.</p>
