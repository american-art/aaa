<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Doll &amp; Richards gallery originated in Boston in 1866 as an art gallery and framing shop owned by Charles E. Hendrickson, E. Adam Doll, and Joseph Dudley Richards.  The gallery was a well-known Boston establishment for over 100 years that represented William Stanley Haseltine, Winslow Homer, William Morris Hunt, and Andrew Wyeth, among many other notable American painters, sculptors, and printmakers. </p> 

<p>In 1870 Hendrickson retired and the gallery became Doll &amp; Richards.  After the untimely death of Doll in 1880, Richards purchased Doll's interest in the firm, retaining the gallery's well-known name. Under Richards' direction, the gallery prospered. Richards promoted the works of painter Winslow Homer, developing a market for his watercolors in Boston.  He incorporated the gallery in 1902 and served as the treasurer and financier until his death in 1922 at 80 years old.  The gallery then reorganized; Arthur McKean, who joined in 1911, became manager, and J.L. (Joe) Richards became treasurer. Fergus Turner, who joined the firm as a salesman in 1885 and became president in 1902, retained his role as president until 1938.</p>

<p>Over the century the gallery showcased contempory American artists, including William Morris Hunt, Dodge McKnight, William Stanley Haseltine, Laura Coombs Hills, Eliot O'Hara, Joseph Lindon Smith, Stanley Woodward, and Andrew Wyeth. The gallery also consigned paintings, prints, and objects from other major art galleries including Azeez Khayat Gallery, Kennedy Galleries, M. Knoedler and Co., Macbeth Gallery, Victor D. Spark, and Victor Waddington Galleries (Dublin, Ireland). According to long-time employee Wendell Zoehler (employed from 1929-1966), Doll &amp; Richards' primary clientele came from the Social Register.  In the summer months when wealthy Bostonians typically vacationed outside of the city, Doll &amp; Richards remained open for tourists, many of whom became regular seasonal customers of the gallery.</p>

<p>The gallery experienced financial difficulties in the 1930s, leading to bankruptcy. Doll &amp; Richards was purchased by McKean and incorporated in Maine in 1941.  McKean sold Doll &amp; Richards in 1962 to Maurice Goldberg; at this time none of the remaining family or staff were connected with the gallery.  In 1973, the gallery was sold to Jeanne and Paul Sylva and closed.</p>

<p>Although the gallery always remained in the vicinity of Boston Common, it relocated numerous times over the years. In 1871 the gallery moved from 28 Summer Street to 145 Tremont Street.  In 1878, the gallery remodeled and occupied the entire two-story building at 2 Park Street, renting out the second floor, known as the Hawthorne Room, for lectures.  After thirty years on Park Street, Doll &amp; Richards relocated to Newbury Street in 1908, beginning a succession of moves down Newbury Street approximately every twenty years, finally to 172 Newbury Street in 1962.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The records of the Doll &amp; Richards gallery of Boston measure 82.7 linear feet and date from 1863 to 1978, with the bulk of the material dating from 1902-1960s.  Extensive financial and sales records, inventory records, and correspondence and letter books provide a detailed account of the business operations and sales of the gallery. Also found are notes and research files on artists and paintings, business and legal records, exhibition catalogs, six exhibition scrapbooks, printed materials, and photographs.  The bulk of the collection dates from 1902 when the gallery was incorporated and new books were begun. According to gallery employee Wendell Zoehler, many records from the 19th century were discarded and periodically, especially when the gallery moved, other records were discarded.</p>

<p>Incoming and outgoing correspondence documents sales, consignments, appraisals, exhibitions, and inquiries by artists and others to Doll &amp; Richards for over a century.  Significant correspondents include artists John Chetcuti, Robert Freiman, Tod Lindenmuth, William Meyerowitz, Dwight Shepler, Elizabeth O'Neill Verner, Stanley Woodward, Andrew Wyeth, and others.  Additional correspondents include Lloyd Goodrich from Whitney Museum of American Art, Azeez Khayat Gallery, Macbeth Galleries, Kleemann Galleries, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.  There is one letter from George Inness (1866).  Outgoing correspondence is limited to 46 volumes of letterpress copybooks dating from 1930-1967.</p>

<p>Notes and research files primarily consist of compiled information about artists in which Doll &amp; Richards dealt. These include card files related to the provenance of paintings by Winslow Homer and William Stanley Haseltine, and a book about Winslow Homer with notations by Zoehler about the sale of paintings .</p>

<p>Administrative and business records of general daily operations include an address book, meeting minutes, miscellaneous lists and notes, and a large card file of contacts with clients, consignors, artists, and businesses. A detailed description of the gallery's operations by Zoehler is also found here. Legal records include contracts, agreements, certificates of stock, certificates of copyrights, and photocopies of founding documents.</p>

<p>Although there are limited records prior to 1902, the financial records provide comprehensive detail of the gallery's financial transactions from the turn of the century through the early 1970s. Volumes of financial ledgers provide details of artwork bought, sold, and consigned; order forms for sales, framing, restoration, and shipping; gallery expenditures and salaries; records of client purchases; and other affairs.  Many of the financial records are indexed and cross-referenced,  offering researchers complex but rich documentation.  The financial records should be consulted with the numerous inventory records that provide detailed information about the stock of art work held at the gallery.  Inventory records also include documentation about the frames held by the gallery from the mid-1880s-1950.  The gallery used sometimes complex codes to index and cross reference sales and stock.  When known, these codes have been outlined in the more detailed series desciptions below, or filed within the appropriate boxes. </p>

<p>The history of Doll &amp; Richards' exhibitions from the 1880s-1968 are documented in six disassembled bound volumes that contained exhibition catalogs and announcements.  There are also additional loose catalogs and announcements. Additional printed materials include newspaper clippings related to exhibitions and the gallery and seven scrapbooks related to Doll &amp; Richards' exhibitions from 1909-1943.</p>

<p>The bulk of the black and white photographs in the collection are of works of art by artists that Doll &amp; Richards exhibited.  There are only a handful of photographs of other subject matter, but include images of the gallery spaces at 2 Park Street, 71 Newbury, and 138 Newberry; and of artists.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Notes and research files include research compiled by Doll &amp; Richards on artists and paintings in which the gallery exhibited or were interested in.  Materials are varied and include clippings; compiled biographies; exhibition announcements and catalogs, many with notations; notecards on reported sales of paintings with references to works by Homer and Sargent; miscellaneous notes; price lists; scattered photographs; and a book about Winslow Homer with marginalia by Wendell Zoehler regarding exhibitions and sales.</p>

<p>Also found are two sets of card files: Arthur McKean's card file for Winslow Homer paintings, and Wendell Zoehler's card file for William Stanley Haseltine paintings.  The original order of each card file has been retained.  The Winslow Homer card file is separated into oils and watercolors/drawings, and then arranged alphabetically by the title of the artwork.  Each of the approximately 700 cards contains information such as when it was received and from whom, sale price and net (in code), date of sale, identification number related to the records of works ledger books (found in Series 6, Inventory), sales and work order form number (found in Subseries 5.2, Financial Records, Sales), when and where it was exhibited, a description of the painting, and a bibliography.  An explanation of the sale price code is filed with the cards.  The William Stanley Haseltine card file is arranged alphabetically by institution or buyer name and includes such information as purchaser, size, price, and sales and work order form number.</p>

<p>Additional scattered research materials about artwork are also found in the Series 8, Photographs.</p>

<p>Business records include minutes of meetings and other general records pertaining to the day-to-day gallery operations, such as contacts cards and mailing lists, framing and matting information, labels, exhibition records, and miscellaneous lists and notes about customers and artwork.  A detailed description of the gallery's operations by Wendell Zoehler is also found here. </p>

<p>Six shoeboxes of index cards record contacts primarily of customers, but also artists, consignors, and businesses.  Cards typically include first and last name, address, dates of contact and the initials of the Doll &amp; Richards employee, a code in the upper right-hand corner, and notes such as occupation or date of death.  For customers, the artist's name, description of artwork, date, and price of paintings bought is written on the back of the card.  Cards appear to be arranged in three groups - current contacts, contacts removed from the file, and contacts which need to be filed or removed.  Within these groups, the cards are in loose alphabetical order by last name or business name.

<p>Financial records provide an extensive and rich source of gallery sales and other transactions.  Financial records prior to 1902 are limited; however, from 1902 through the 1960s, the records are comprehensive and frequently cross-referenced.  The records provide multiple access points via date, customer or consignor name, artist name, and sales and work form number.</p> 
</scopecontent>

<arrangement><p>The series is arranged as two subseries:</p> 
<p>
<list> 
<item>5.1: Gallery Records, 1871-1969</item> 
<item>5.2: Sales Records, circa 1883, 1901-1973, bulk 1902-1968</item>

<c02 level="subseries"><did><unitid>5.1: </unitid>
<unittitle>Gallery Records, <unitdate>1871-1969</unitdate></unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> 
<p>The financial records of the gallery include accounts receivable and payable ledgers, voluminous card files for accounts, account ledgers, cashbooks, checkstubs, daybooks, journals, price lists, and other financial ledgers.</p>

<p>Records of accounts with customers, consignors, artists, merchants, galleries, museums, and others are housed in oversized ledgers from 1902-1911 and on card files from 1911-1968, providing comprehensive documentation of the gallery's transactions and access points to information based on names.  Each ledger includes an index, and entries include cross-references to daybooks, journals, and cash books.  Each card includes the account name and address; dates and amounts of transactions; balance on the account; cross-references to the page in the daybook, journal, or cash book in which the entry was made; and occasionally notes about the account.  Cards are arranged in alphabetical order by the account name.   Additional subject cards such as "advertising," "restoration," and "private books" are arranged at the end of the card file; some subject cards are also filed alphabetically with the account cards.  Also filed at the end of the card file are cards for accounts which were active or unresolved, or which needed to be filed.  
</p>

<p>Cash books (labeled "A"-"Q") record daily credits and debits.  Each entry includes the date, details of the transaction, and costs incurred for merchandise, manufacturing, labor, etc.  Older entries (1902-1911) reference the page in which the account was recorded in the oversized account ledgers.</p>

<p>Daybooks (labeled "DBA"-"DBT") record individual transactions from 1902-1966, and include details such as the date, buyer or merchant name, cost of purchase or sale price, and the cost of supplies or gallery expenses.  Each entry also includes the sales and work order form numbers for cross-reference; in the older daybooks (1902-1911) the page in which the account is recorded in the oversized account ledgers is also included.  All transactions on each page are totaled and balanced.</p>

<p>Invoice and Sales Accounts books (1871-1967) list drawings, etchings, photographs, bronzes, furniture, watercolors, prints, lithographs, paintings, and other works of art, often in lots, on consignment from various owners.  Many entries include details of the disposition of the work of art.  The entries are arranged by sale lot number and, since these were assigned in order of occurrence, the entries are also chronological.  However, some earlier sale lot numbers are repeated at the beginning of later books.</p>

<p>Journals (labeled "A"-"P") record the gallery's transactions for services such as gilding or joining, frame supplies, restoration of paintings, sales of works of art, purchases of prints, shipping, salaries, utilities, office supplies, etc.  The front and back covers of the ledger books were removed for preservation.</p>

<p>Price lists are typically typed or written on exhibition catalogs; occasionally the price list also includes a name, presumably of the buyer.  Additional price lists and notes on prices of artwork are scattered within Series 1, Series 3, Series 7, and Series 8.</p>

The sales and work order forms were filled out when sales were made or orders were taken for work such as framing, restoration, and shipping.  The sales and work order forms typically include the buyer's name and address, date, form number, price, and details such as the cross-section of the frame or notations such as "DBN 21," indicating the sale was recorded in Daybook N, page 21.  Each form is numbered and many bear a letter prefix.  According to Wendell Zoehler, the letter "A" indicates sales by Fergus Turner; "C," Arthur McKean; and "D," Wendell Zoeller.  The letter "B" is for sales of paintings and watercolors.  Those represented by the letters "L," "LE," "S" are unknown. Sales by Lucius B. Peck are also represented by a letter, but it is unknown which one.</p>

<p>Folders are arranged alphabetically by subject. Sales and work order forms are grouped by the letter prior to the form number and filed alphabetically; forms without a letter prior to the form number are filed first.  Within each group, forms are arranged in numerical order based on the form number, which corresponds loosely to chronological order. Other sales forms for Helen Plowden/William Stanley Haseltine were removed from their original location and collocated into five boxes, presumably by the gallery. The order for these forms has been retained and are filed at the end of the subseries.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Inventory records provide another access point in which to research the provenance of artwork held by Doll &amp; Richards.  There are seven volumes of ledgers which record details of artwork on hand at Doll &amp; Richards from 1881-1969.  Also found are inventory books for prints and frames, including a frame profile book that shows cross-sections of frame moldings and an index to frame manufacturers.</p>

<p>Entries in the records of works on hand typically include the artist's name, title of work, description, cost, date received, remarks, owner, price, and disposition.  Each volume contains separate indices for artists and for owners.  Identification numbers are assigned to each entry.  Each volume has been assigned specific page numbers (eg. 1-100, 101-200, etc.) and each page has 20 entries, one for each piece of artwork.  Thus an entry on line 15 of page 207 is given the identification number 207/15.  Beginning with the third volume which starts in 1895, entries of unsold works from earlier volumes were transferred to unnumbered pages at the front of later volumes.</p>

<p>An account of most of the exhibitions held at Doll &amp; Richards from the 1880s-1968 can be created from the abundant exhibition announcements and catalogs.  Found are six exhibition announcement and catalog books, disassembled and housed in folders in their original order of reverse chronological; loose exhibition announcements and catalogs; fragile clippings from newspapers; and a book, "William Stanley Haseltine," inscribed to Wendell Zoehler from Helen Haseltine Plowden.  Many exhibition catalogs are annotated with notes and prices, and scattered price lists and notes can also be found here.  Duplicate copies of announcements and catalogs have not been weeded.</p>
