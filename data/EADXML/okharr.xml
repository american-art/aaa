            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>OK Harris Works of Art specialized in a wide range of contemporary art and was known for its early support of Photo-realism. When it opened in 1969, the gallery was one of the first to operate in the SoHo area of Manhattan and its presence helped shape the neighborhood's development into a vibrant arts district.</p>
            <p>Ivan C. Karp (1926-2012), the founder of OK Harris Works of Art, established a reputation in the art world while co-director of Leo Castelli Gallery from 1959-1969. He is credited with launching the careers of Pop artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, John Chamberlain, Tom Wesselmann, and Claes Oldenburg. Karp wrote, published, and lectured extensively on art and the art business. He was the author of a romantic novel about New York life, 
                <emph render="italic">Doobie Doo</emph> (published in 1965, front cover by Roy Lichtenstein, back cover by Andy Warhol) and his short stories were published in literary reviews. Karp was actively involved in architectural preservation efforts in New York City. As President of the Anonymous Arts Recovery Society, he rescued and stored cornices, capitals, portals, columns and other architectural fragments of historical and aesthetic interest from demolition sites. Many are displayed in his Anonymous Arts Museum, Charlotteville, NY and some became part of a sculpture garden that Karp donated to the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</p>
            <p>While Leo Castelli Gallery was closed for summer vacations in 1963 and 1964, Karp ran his own contemporary art gallery in Provincetown. He named it OK Harris, a name he thought suggestive of a colorful, very American character. A few years later, Karp opened OK Harris Works of Art in SoHo where a portrait of a bearded man titled "Oscar Klondike Harris" hung in his office. "Mr. Harris" frequently assumed blame for delays, rejections and other unwelcome news or decisions. OK Harris Works of Art (first at 469 West Broadway and later at 383 West Broadway) was a 10,000 square foot ground-floor space where as many as six concurrent solo exhibitions were presented every six weeks. The goal was "to exhibit the broadest spectrum of the most adventuresome art being offered" and the focus was on emerging artists, many of them unknown. In addition to being at the forefront of the Photo-realist movement in 1969, OK Harris Works of Art was the first gallery to exhibit the work of Duane Hanson, Deborah Butterfield, Manny Farber, Richard Pettibone, Robert Cottingham, Robert Bechtle, Marilyn Levine, Nancy Rubins, Malcolm Morley, Luis Jiminez, Jake Berthot, Jack Goldstein, Porfirio DiDonna, and Al Souza.</p>
            <p>An approachable, friendly man who enjoyed sharing his knowledge, Karp usually sat at the gallery's front desk and was available to all. Unlike many dealers, he was willing to look at and discuss artists' slides, offered encouragement, and often followed up with studio visits.</p>
            <p>At his request, Marilynn Gelfman Karp became gallery director after her husband's death in 2012. She ran the business with gallery staff including Ivan's oldest son, Ethan. Following Ivan's guidelines, OK Harris Works of Art closed with a gala celebration 2014 for all the gallery's artists, collectors and friends.</p>

                    <p>The personal and professional correspondence of Ivan C. Karp includes letters addressed to Ivan Karp, Marilynn Gelfman Karp, the couple, and to the gallery. Typed letters, e-mail, and handwritten items sometimes show Karp's canny sense of humor. Included are Karp's responses to detailed questions from graduate students and art professionals regarding his areas of expertise, as well as letters of reference or support. Many letters from established members of the art world and others express gratitude to the Karps for their helpfulness and generosity. Correspondents include museums, schools, galleries, dealers, collectors, and artists.</p>
                    <p>Some items of note include a letter from Chuck Close asking for Karp's support for a fellow artist with a neurological disorder. Correspondence between Marilynn Gelfman-Pereira Karp and Jasper Johns (signed in his absence by assistant Mark Lancaster) is about stabilizing

An e-mail from President Obama to "Ivan" thanks him for supporting the passage of the Affordable Health Care Act. Letters from Karp to Hilton Kramer and William Grimes express his opinions on issues of the day. More typical, are letters written by Karp concerning gallery business and his opinions about the value or authenticity of specific works.</p>
                    <p>Holiday cards received by the Karps are mostly handmade. Also found are letters to art critic Andy Grundberg of 
                        <emph render="italic">The New York Times </emph>questioning why he seldom reviews exhibitions at OK Harris Works of Art; many of these letters are blind copies received by Karp.</p>

                    <p>This series documents the manner in which OK Harris Works of Art conducted business. There are forms for reccurring activities, statements of business practices, and materials to guide gallery personnel in dealings with visitors and artists. Other records concern experiments with selling postcards, reproductions, and the OK Now Watch at the gallery. Also found are samples of announcements, invitations, advertising, and a few files on miscellaneous projects that were important to Ivan and Marilynn Karp.</p>

                    <p>Files of note include "Ivan's Choices: Icons of Hyper-Realism" (2012 January 6-2013 March 2) and "Ivan C. Karp: People/Places, 1948-1963" (2013 January 6-March 2); both exhibitions were selected and arranged by Karp. Also of interest are records regarding the final show held by OK Harris Works of Art (2014 March 9-April 18) featuring work by many of the gallery's artists.</p>

                    <p>Artists' files consist of business and personal correspondence, biographical information, checklists, contracts, receipts, printed material, photographs, slides and color transparencies in various combinations. The files document arrangements for exhibitions, loans, consignments, shipping, and miscellaneous transactions with OK Harris Works of Art. The most extensively documented artists are: John Baeder, Muriel Castanis, Don Celender, Ralph Goings, John Kacere, Richard McLean, Robert Rohm and John Salt. Files regarding Don Celender include many of his surveys that were exhibited at OK Harris. Ephemera from Celender exhibitions consists of three different boxes for "OK Harris Art Crackers" based on the traditional animal cracker box, and two Chinese take out cartons of "Art Dealers Fortune Cookies" and "Art Curators Fortune Cookies."</p>

                    <p>This series retains the order and labeling used by the gallery. Artists' files are identified as "Current" (active) or "Past" (no longer represented by OK Harris). Current files are categorized as "Group A," "Group B," and "Photographers." Past files are categorized as "Group A," "Group B," and "Group C." According to gallery staff, artists were grouped according to how quickly they could produce enough new work for a show. Some artists are included in both subseries; within each subseries, a few artists are found in more than one group. Over time, it appears that some artists' output changed and filing errors occurred. This series is arranged as 2 subseries:</p>

                    <p>Printed material produced by OK Harris Works of Art includes a complete set of exhibition announcements. Scattered among the announcements are a small number of invitations to gallery events including receptions, openings, a sock hop, a few performances, concerts, and parties. Although OK Harris presented as many as six concurrent exhibitions every six weeks, the number of exhibition catalogs and posters is very small, reflecting the tight schedule. Earlier printed material is particularly creative and unique, each announcement carving out an attention getting and occasionally humorous approach, some with modest shock value. The graphics are usually interesting as are the materials used. Over time, OK Harris's printed items became more traditional with postcard style announcements predominating.</p>
                    <p>Printed material produced by others consists of periodicals, books, exibition catalogs, guidebooks and clippings. Most are about or mention Ivan Karp, Marilyn Karp, gallery artists and exhibitions. Exhibition catalogs feature works by OK Harris artists and works loaned by the gallery; also included are catalogs of shows for which Karp was a juror. Miscellaneous items relate to events with Karp as a speaker or juror. Scattered throughout is general information about SoHo and Photo-realism. Exhibition Posters are: "Amerikanske Realister," Randers Kunstmuseum; "Ivan C. Karp Photographs," California State University, Long Beach; "Los Angeles Heute," Amerika Haus; and "Ivan Karp: The Face of Contemporary Art," Hong Kong Institute for Promotion of Chinese Culture. Miscellaneous posters are: "Walt Disney" by W. Fawcett, "Marihuana" (
                        <emph render="italic">sic</emph>), "Artist being Booked for Exhibiting Without Talent," "Biscuits" by Manuel Hughes, and "Davis Cone."</p>

                    <p>Photographic materials consist of photographs, slides, negatives, and digital images of artwork by artists associated with OK Harris Works of Art and views of the gallery's exhibition installations from 1960s-2014. The majority of photographs and slides carry identifying information, e.g., titles, dates, media, and photographic credits.</p>
                    <p>Artists' photo books consist of copy prints of artwork by 59 artists actively represented by OK Harris Works of Art and by artists formerly associated with the gallery. Artists' slides are of artwork that was exhibited at OK Harris and other galleries from the 1960s-2000s.</p>
                    <p>Installation views preserved in 61 binders document solo exhibitions and other shows presented at OK Harris during its 45 year history. Negatives of OK Harris installations photographed by Eric Pollitzer and Dan Lenore include numbered references, but no key is included. Other installation views include exhibitions by gallery artists at other venues, e.g., the Brevard Museum, New England College and the Studio Art Centers International.</p>
                    <p>Photographs of miscellaneous subjects include a photo book of the gallery's artists exhibiting at art expositions, art fairs, and museums, among them Tokyo Art Expo (1991), the Nevada Institute for Contemporary Art (1994), and the Chicago Art Fair (1999, 2002). Of particular interest are photographs of exhibition openings at 19 Galerie Des 4 Mouvements in Paris and at Galerie de Gestlo in Dusseldorf held during the 1970s. Also found are loose miscellaneous photographs, and an album of photographs of the OK Harris Works of Art galleries, office, and staff including Ivan Karp.</p>

                    <p>The original order of the material has been maintained. Artists' slides are labeled as "Group A" and "Group B." According to gallery staff, the groupings relate to the time artists needed to produce enough new work for an exhibition. Many, but not all volumes are numbered, and damaged binders have been dismantled. Additional photographic materials are included among the artists' files (Series 4) and with Ivan C. Karp's personal papers (Series 8 ). This series is arranged as 4 subseries:</p>

                    <p>The Ivan C. Karp papers consist mainly of journals that record travel and daily life. There are a large number of obituaries from print and internet sources along with other biographical information, published versions of brief interviews with Karp conducted for various purposes, writings, a few materials relating to business and academic activities, and some photographs.</p>
                    <p>The majority of this series consits of photocopies of Ivan C. Karp's journals from the period 1950-2012 (bulk 1991-2012). The earliest are travel journals written during trips to Italy, Spain, France, and more unusual destinations such as Bulgaria, Tunisia, Egypt, Poland, and Guatemala. The observant and thoughtul young Ivan Karp included salient details of travel and everyday life. Some entries are accompanied by drawings, and his interest in wordplay is evident. Later daily journals, written when Karp was an established art dealer, are more organized and less personal. Photographs, clippings, maps, and wine labels are occasionally included to illustrate statements or add interest. He wrote about scheduled activities, food and wine, sports, music, politics, and often commented on the weather. While daily journals record travel experiences at home and abroad, little mention is made of family or friends.</p>
                    <p>Writings by Karp include articles, introductions and essays for exhibition catalogs, and a chapter in a book about the business of art. Among the writings by others is
                        <emph render="italic"> I Married an Art Dealer</emph> by Marilynn Karp. Also found are an academic paper, "Reflections on American Super Realism and Photo Realism" by Michael Jucker, and a dissertation by Suzanne Pines, "Five Photo-Realists: Process and Perceptions" (Columbia University, 1979). Among the small number of photographs are several digitial copies of earlier images of Karp including him in uniform during World War II and several at his gallery.</p>
