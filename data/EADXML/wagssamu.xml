            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Samuel J. Wagstaff, Jr. (1921-1987), the son of a lawyer from an old New York family and fashion artist Olga Piorkowska, was born in New York City. A graduate of Yale University, he was an ensign in the Navy and took part in the D-day landing at Omaha Beach.</p>
            <p>Following World War II, Wagstaff studied Renaissance art at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. A David E. Finley art history fellowship took him to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C. in 1959. He served as curator of contemporary art at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Conn., from 1961 to 1968, where he coordinated sculptor Tony Smith's first museum show in 1966. In 1971, during Wagstaff's tenure as curator at the Detroit Institute of Arts (1968-1971), he presented Michael Heizer's installation 
                <emph render="italic">Dragged Mass Geometric</emph> on the grounds of the museum.</p>
            <p>In addition to his curatorial work, Samuel J. Wagstaff was a noted collector. Originally, he was a fairly influential collector of avant-garde paintings. After seeing the exhibition "The Painterly Photograph" and meeting photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, Wagstaff became convinced that photographs were the most unrecognized and, possibly, the most valuable works of art. He moved to New York and began selling his collection of paintings, using the proceeds to begin his photography collection and concentrating on 19th century American, British, and French examples. Then, influenced by his lover, photographer Mapplethorpe, Wagstaff's taste veered toward the daring, and he began to depart from established names in search of new talent. His collection was soon recognized as one of the finest private holdings in the United States. An exhibition of his photographs was organized by the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C., in 1978, and 
                <emph render="italic">A Book of Photographs from the Sam Wagstaff Collection</emph> was published to accompany the show that toured the country.</p>
            <p>The photograph collection was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu, Calif., in 1984, for a reported $5 million. Wagstaff then focused his attention on collecting 19th century American silver, and a selection from that collection was exhibited at the New York Historical Society in 1987.</p>
            <p>Samuel J. Wagstaff died in New York City on January 14, 1987, from pneumonia, a complication of HIV infection.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Samuel J. Wagstaff papers, circa 1932-1985, comprise 6.2 linear feet of correspondence, writings, miscellaneous records, printed material, and photographs documenting Wagstaff's professional and personal relationships with artists and photographers, his career as an art curator, and his position as an important collector of paintings and photographs.</p>
            <p>Correspondence with artists and others such as curators, arts organizations, galleries, and museums reflects the diversity of contemporary American art and includes individuals associated with the abstract expressionist, Fluxus, pop, earth, conceptual, and minimalist art movements. Wagstaff's importance as a collector and curator and his generosity to and interest in artists is evident from the large number of invitations to view and critique work, requests for fellowship and grant recommendations, and thank you notes from artists to whom he extended financial or moral support. Among the most prolific correspondents found here are: Dan Basen, George Brecht, James Lee Byars, Walter de Maria, Mark Di Suvero, Albert Fine, Dan Flavin, Ann Halprin, Grace Hartigan, Charles James, Philip Johnson, Ray Johnson, Doreen and Robert Manning, Agnes Martin, Gordon Newton, Claes Oldenburg, Ad Reinhardt, Dieter Rot, Alan Saret, Richard Tuttle, May Wilson, and Andy Warhol.</p>
            <p>Writings by Wagstaff consist of "Looking at Modern Art" prepared for the Trinity College Reading Program, and an untitled, undated piece about multiplicity in art. Among the writings by other authors are Bruce Bennard's "The Photographer Rediscovered," "Pop Art" by Henry Geldzahler, and "Collecting Photographs" by Bonnie Barrett Stretch.</p>
            <p>Miscellaneous records are drawings by Bruce Kleinsmith, a print by Harold Paris and artists' resumes. Also included is a costume consisting of a stuffed devil's tail and two red silk caps connected by a long sash, all in a matching red silk bag.</p>
            <p>Among the printed material are books, exhibition catalogs and prospectuses, periodicals, press releases, reproductions, and a variety of other printed items relating to photography and art.</p>
            <p>Photographs consist largely of copy prints and a small number of original prints. Also included are a few images of exhibition installations and other miscellaneous subjects. There are no portraits of Samuel J. Wagstaff among the photographs of people. Identified individuals include: Bella Abzug, Peter Allen, Michael Collins, Angela Davis, Candy Darling, Wendell Ford, Joseph Hirshhorn, W. A. Huffman, David Love, Marc Miller, Bettie Ringma, and Andy Warhol.</p>

                        <p>This subseries consists almost exclusively of incoming letters with a few carbon copies of Wagstaff's outgoing letters. There are a large number of illustrated letters, and many letters have printed items, photographs, and artwork as attachments.</p>
                        <p>Correspondence is with artists and others such as curators, arts organizations, galleries, and museums.

Wagstaff's importance as a collector and curator and his generosity to, and interest in, artists is evident from the large number of invitations to view and critique work, requests for fellowship and grant recommendations, and thank you notes from artists to whom he extended financial or moral support.

Items of note are James Lee Byars's letters, many of which are extremely large and written on unusual surfaces such as clear plastic and pink toilet tissue, and a letter from Thomas Hart Benton that describes the early work of Jackson Pollock. Also included are many illustrated letters and examples of mail art. Some of the Byars letters could not be digitized due to their extreme size.</p>

                    <p>Photographs consist largely of copy prints and a very small number of original prints filed by photographer. Miscellaneous subjects are book covers and pages, exhibition installations, and an exterior view of the International Center of Photogaphy (Willard Straight house). No images of Samuel J. Wagstaff are included. Among the photographs of people are: Bella Abzug, Michael Collins, Angela Davis, Candy Darling, Wendell Ford, Joseph Hirshhorn, Bettie Ringma, and Andy Warhol, as well as unidentified individuals.</p>
                    <p>Additional photographs may be found attached to correspondence (Series 1), and among the writings (Series 4) accompanying a manuscript about portrait photographs.</p>
