<bioghist altrender="biography" encodinganalog="545" id="a2">
<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jacob Kainen is remembered as painter, printmaker, teacher, curator, and collector.  Born on December 7, 1909 in Waterbury, Connecticut, Kainen's family moved to New York City in 1918.  Kainen studied at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from 1927 until 1930, and at the Art Student's League.  In the early 1930s, Kainen became involved in social causes and formed close friendships with the early abstractionists, including John Graham,  Ashile Gorky, and Stuart Davis.  He joined the Artists' Union and became a contributor to its journal, <emph render="italic">Art Front</emph>, along with Stuart Davis and Harold Rosenberg.  Jacob's participation in the Artists' Union was later investigated by the FBI.</p>
<p>From 1935 until 1942, Kainen worked for the Graphic Arts Division of the Works Progress Administration in New York City and began exhibiting with the New York School.  It was during this period that he married Bertha Friedman.  Jacob and Bertha had two sons together, Dan and Paul, and divorced in 1968.  In 1942, Kainen made a life-changing decision to leave New York City and move to Washington, D.C. to accept what he thought would be a temporary position as a scientific aide in the Division of Graphic Arts at the Smithsonian Institution.  Kainen became Assistant Curator and then Curator in 1946.  He served as Curator for twenty years, completely reshaping the department and building the graphic arts collection.  His print exhibitions brought the work of S.W. Hayter, Josef Albers, Adja Yunkers, Louis Lozowick, Karl Schrag, José Guerrero, Louis Schanker, Werner Drewes, and Boris Margo to Washington audiences - graphic work that might not have been shown that early in the area.  </p>
<p>1947 marked the opening of the Washington Workshop Center for the Arts, where Kainen served as a teacher and guide to several important artists, helping to make the workshop a magnet for new talent and instrumental in furthering the careers of several artists.  Although Kainen taught Gene Davis and Alma Thomas and introduced Morris Louis to Leon Berkowitz, he never considered himself a member of the "Washington Color School."  </p>
<p>In 1949, the Corcoran Gallery of Art held a retrospective of Kainen's prints and three years later Kenneth Noland organized Kainen's first painting retrospective at Catholic University.  Kainen's paintings from the 1940s illustrated a shift away from social realism toward abstract expressionism.  In 1956, Jacob Kainen received a grant from the American Philosophical society to conduct research in Europe for his monograph on the English woodcut artist, John Baptist Jackson.  He traveled to Europe again in 1962 to study paintings and prints from the Mannerist Period.</p>
<p>From 1966 until 1970, Kainen worked as the Curator of prints and drawings at the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum).  He married Ruth Cole in February of 1969.  Kainen retired from the Smithsonian a year later to devote himself full-time to his art, but continued to serve as a special consultant to the Smithsonian American Art Museum for nineteen years.  In 1971 and 1972, Kainen taught painting and the history of printmaking at the University of Maryland.  A retrospective of Kainen's paintings was held in 1993 at the National Museum of American Art (SAAM).</p>
<p>Throughout his artistic career,  Kainen experimented with different mediums and explored different styles, yet he identified himself as a painter.  Jacob Kainen participated in at least twenty-five one man shows and several group exhibitions.  His works are in collections across the United States and abroad, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the British Museum.  He worked in his studio up until the time of his death on March 19, 2001 at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Jacob Kainen papers date from 1905 to 2003 (bulk 1940-2001), and measure 17 linear feet.  The collection consists primarily of personal correspondence to and from friends and family members and professional correspondence concerning Kainen's activities as an artist, curator, teacher and art collector.  The collection also contains biographical material, writings, diaries, inventories, transcripts, printed material, photographs, works of art by other artists, and a videocassette.</p>
<p>Biographical materials include items concerning Kainen's career as a curator and artist,  in addition to a useful bibliography, detailed biographical outline, and a copy of an FBI report compiled on him.  Correspondence/Subject files comprise the bulk of the collection and contain correspondence to and from both Jacob and Ruth Kainen's family members and friends concerning personal and professional matters.  A historical as well as personal context for Jacob Kainen is established through his correspondence with several leading artists, critics, and curators of the time.   The variety of correspondents within the series reflects Kainen's diverse experiences as an artist, teacher, curator, and collector.  A substantial portion of the correspondence consists of letters specifically addressed to and written solely by Ruth Kainen.  </p>
<p>Writings include materials written by and about Jacob Kainen.  Kainen's formal and more scholarly articles and lectures are included with his short stories and poems dating from the 1930s through the 1990s.  The series also includes several statements Kainen made regarding his artistic motivations and justifications.  Dairies include both Jacob and Ruth Kainen's diary entries with Jacob Kainen's diaries dating mostly from the 1950s and 1960s and Ruth Kainen's entries covering more recent events from the 1970s though the 1990s.  Also found are calendars, including daily calendars and travel itineraries from 1972 through 2001.</p>
<p>Transcripts of informal conversations with and formal interviews of Jacob Kainen constitute the next series and include interviews with reporters and critics, and conversations with friends and fellow artists.  Many of the interviews and conversations contain comments from Ruth Kainen as well as Jacob Kainen.  Also found are inventories of paintings by Jacob Kainen that were sold, missing, or unsold along with color photographs of some of Kainen's paintings.  Printed materials include Kainen's exhibition catalogs and announcements, clippings of articles by and about Jacob Kainen, and an exhibition guestbook.</p>
<p>A substantial number of photographs are contained in the papers including those of Kainen with his family and friends, at exhibition openings, and working in his studios.  Works of art by others includes handmade greeting cards, limited edition prints, and portfolios given to Jacob Kainen.  The final item in the collection is a videocassette about the artist Martin Ries.</p>

<p>The series includes personal and professional correspondence to and from family members, friends, scholars, artists, curators, and students.  There is a significant amount of material dealing with exhibitions, donations, gifts, and appraisals of items from Kainen's art collection.  Some notable correspondents include Clement Greenberg, Stuart Davis, and S.W. Hayter.  A substantial amount of correspondence was written and received exclusively by Ruth Cole Kainen.  The series contains some photographs, printed material, and handmade cards.  The correspondence files and subject files were combined into one series as in the original arrangement by the Kainen's.  In most cases, the correspondence was originally arranged alphabetically by the correspondent's name, but there were a few files included in the original series that were filed by subject and contained correspondence relating to a specific topic or event.  Correspondents with fewer than five letters are filed alphabetically in miscellaneous folders.</p>

<p>The series consists primarily of handmade greeting cards and limited edition prints given to Jacob and Ruth Kainen.  The cards contain lithographs, etchings, pen and ink drawings, and woodblock prints by various artists such as Tadeusz Lapinski, Un-ichi Hiratsuka, and Raphael Soyer.  Alberta Mayo's portfolio, entitled "Remembering Paradise:  Postcards from Southern California," is also part of the series.  The series contains a variety of materials given to Kainen by the artist, Irving Amen.  The series is arranged alphabetically by the artist's last name and chronologically under each heading.  Artists with fewer than five items are filed alphabetically in miscellaneous folders.  The material by Irving Amen is organized further by the type of material (i.e. by works of art, photographs, and printed material) and then chronologically.  See Appendix B for a complete list of the miscellaneous artists.</p>
