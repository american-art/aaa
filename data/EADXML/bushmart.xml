            <p>Bush received a Bachelor of Arts from the State University of New York at Albany in 1958. From 1963-1965, he taught at Syracuse University, where he earned his Ph.D in History in 1966.

In this post, Bush established a special collections department at Ablah Library and the Ulrich Museum of Art. Bush was also a consultant to several major corporations in Wichita, including Fourth Financial Corporation, Range Oil Company, and American Diversified Real Estate. In 1974, in recognition of Bush's contribution to the museum, the University opened the Martin H. Bush Outdoor Sculpture Collection. Bush has been involved in the acquisition of major pieces of outdoor sculpture from such well-known artists as Chaim Gross, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Juan Miró, Louise Nevelson, and George Rickey. In 1989, Bush moved to New York City, where he continued his work as an art consultant. From 1992-1993, he was President of the ACA Gallery.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>This series includes files on Martin H. Bush's dealings with individual artists, mostly relating to exhibitions, some organized by Martin H. Bush and sales of artwork. There are extensive files on Richard Pousette-Dart, Robert Goodnough, Ernest Trova, and Isaac Witkin. Auction files document Bush's consulting projects for art institutions, such as Owensboro Museum of Art and the Ulrich Museum of Art as well as his activities as a collector. Files may include a variety of material, such as correspondence, drafts, memoranda, proposals, informational sheets, lists of artwork, inventory lists, condition reports, printed material, clippings and reviews, exhibition catalogs, annotated auction catalogs, and photographic materials, including slides and transparencies. Among the business-related materials are appraisals, price lists, sale sheets, bids, lists of deaccessioned artwork, consignment agreements, condition reports, receipts, and invoices. There is limited documentation relating to Bush's directorship at ACA Gallery.</p>
                    <p>Also found are Martin H. Bush's correspondence with Samuel Beckett, including three holograph letters and one typescript letter from Beckett; John Von Wicht's illustrated letters; and an annotated typescript of Bush's account of his initial meeting with Joan Miró. Other source files include a list of scholars conducting research for catalogue raisonné projects, obituary notices on friends and acquaintances, and the Ulrich Museum of Art, particularly the museum's twentieth-fifth anniversary celebration. Two videorecordings of an ESPN "Up Close" Interview and and ESPN Hall of Fame induction ceremony reflect Bush's interest in baseball.</p>
                    <p>Subject files include 11 videocassettes and 1 electronic disc (DVD).</p>
