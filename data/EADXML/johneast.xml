<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>American painter and printmaker Jonathan Eastman Johnson was born in Lovell, Maine in 1824.  After apprenticing with a Boston lithographer, he moved to Washington D.C. in 1845 and became a portraitist of prominent Americans, including Daniel Webster and Dolly Madison.  Beginning in 1849, Johnson spent two years at the Royal Academy in Dusseldorf, Germany, studying with Emanuel Leutze, and three years at The Hague.  After returning to America in 1855, he settled in New York and focused on painting American genre subjects including Native Americans, African Americans, and farmers.  He married Elizabeth Buckley in 1869, and they bought a home in Nantucket where he spent every summer for the rest of his life.  After 1880, as the popularity of genre paintings declined, Johnson focused again on portraiture.  He died in 1906.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The letters of Eastman Johnson contain 12 items and date from 1851 to 1899.  The letters provide scattered documentation of his career as a painter and printmaker.</p>
<p>The collection includes a letter to Mr. Champney concerning a painting by Eugene Benson, a letter to Charles Lanman, personal Secretary to Daniel Webster, a letter to Alfred Ordway, artist and Director of Paintings at the Boston Athenaeum, a letter to friend and patron John Coyle, and a letter to Mr. Cozzens concerning a painting which was already sold.  Also found are two letters to artist and close friend Jervis McEntee, a letter to an unidentified Mrs. P, stating that he must go to Albany before starting another picture, a letter to Mr. Clark concerning a portrait, and a letter to Dr. Hochheimer regarding a print by Henry Wolf after one of Johnson's paintings.  Also included in the collection is an oversize letter, written by Johnson in Dusseldorf, to his friend Charlotte Child, in which he speaks of his impressions of Germany, mutual friends, and working in Leutze's studio.</p>
