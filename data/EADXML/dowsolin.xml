<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Olin Dows (1904-1981) was a painter and arts administrator; he primarily lived and worked in Rhinebeck, New York.  Dows was born in Irvington-on-Hudson, NY.  He graduated from Harvard University in 1926 and also studied at the Yale School of Fine Arts.  In 1935 he was appointed director of the Treasury Relief Art Project, funded by the Works Progress Administration.  In 1938 he painted a series of murals for the post office in Rhinebeck, NY, and in 1941 painted murals for the post office in Hyde Park, NY.  From 1938 to 1941 Dows was on the Board of Directors of the American Federation of Arts. In 1942 he enlisted in the Army Engineers Corps and was commissioned as a war artist, covering the European Theater of Operations. An exhibit of works produced by this project was held in 1944, entitled "The Army at War."  Dows was discharged from the army in 1945.  A book of his watercolors, <emph render="italic">Franklin Roosevelt at Hyde Park</emph>, was published in 1949.</p>
