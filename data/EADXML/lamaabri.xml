<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Eduardo Abril Lamarque was born in Cuba on August 28, 1904. His parents sent him to the United States in 1916 when he was twelve to study English and business administration. He lived with an American family in Brooklyn. Lamarque's first cartoon was published in the Boy Scout section of the <emph render="italic">New York World-Telegram and Evening Mail</emph> at age 15. Four years later he created <emph render="italic">Bla-Bla</emph>, a comic strip that appeared regularly in the <emph render="italic">New York Daily News</emph>. He is credited with creating, in the early 1920s, the first Spanish language comic strip that was not translated from English. The title cartoon character, <emph render="italic">Monguito</emph>, was a hapless soul, fully dressed in business suit and hat, who kept getting into sticky situations. Lamarque produced hundreds of these strips which were picked up by the New York based United Feature Syndicate and published daily in Spanish language newspapers throughout Latin America and the United States.</p>
<p>When he was twenty, Lamarque returned to Cuba  and worked as the artistic director for the Havana newspaper <emph render="italic">Lunes de Diario de Cuba</emph>. He also published a booklet designed to teach the elements of caricature drawing. Lamarque returned to New York and was hired by the <emph render="italic">New York World Telegram and Evening Mail</emph> as a caricaturist. In this position, he produced political cartoons and caricatures for the paper, introducing his "radiocatures", which involved providing instructions on the radio for filling in a grid in the newspaper to produce a caricature of well-known figure in the news.</p>  
<p>In 1927, at the age of 23, he became the first art director of Dell Publishing Company - a magazine empire that included <emph render="italic">Film Fun</emph>, <emph render="italic">I Confess</emph>, <emph render="italic">War Stories</emph>, <emph render="italic">Modern Screen</emph>, <emph render="italic">Popular Song</emph>, <emph render="italic">Spotlight</emph>, <emph render="italic">Radio Stars</emph>, <emph render="italic">Theatrical Page</emph>, <emph render="italic">Ballyhoo</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Modern Romances</emph>. He continued working there for 14 years.</p>
<p>In 1940-1941, Lamarque established Abril Lamarque Creations, a design firm that specialized in elegant and functional household objects and jewelry in a modernist tradition. His signature piece was the Pallettray, a serving tray modeled after an artist's palette and hand-finished in exotic woods.</p>
<p>Between 1941 and 1946, Lamarque became the first art director for the Sunday edition of the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> and redesigned the <emph render="italic">New York Times Magazine</emph> and the <emph render="italic">New York Times Book Review</emph>. Throughout his career, Lamarque designed and redesigned countless magazines and journals, including <emph render="italic">American Weekly</emph>, <emph render="italic">New York News</emph>, <emph render="italic">Metropolitan Life</emph>, <emph render="italic">Popular Science</emph>, <emph render="italic">This Week</emph>, <emph render="italic">US News-World Report</emph>, and others.</p>
<p>In 1948, Lamarque established a successful graphic design studio in New York that provided a full spectrum of design services, including annual reports, posters, product labeling, corporate publications, advertising, logos, package designs, and brochures. His clients included Barcardi Company, Con Edison, Ericcson Telephone, General Cable, Berlitz School, Lipton, Monsanto, and numerous magazines. In 1958, he was given the National Award for Graphic Design in packaging. His design for the annual American Red Cross poster was selected for the 1948 national Red Cross campaign.</p>   
<p>His success and high demand as a publication art director, consultant, and designer was attributed to innovative design principles he based on the German Bauhaus School and its philosophy that promoted functional design principles. Lamarque reduced these principles to a set of guidelines suitable for page design and applied them successfully to a wide variety of publication and print layouts.</p>
<p>Lamarque's teaching experience began in the early 1940s with seminars and workshops he conducted for the publishing industry. He joined the faculty of New York University School of Continuing Education in 1958, where he taught until 1963, and later joined the Crowell Collier Institute and taught publication design workshops across the United States and Canada. He also gave workshops and courses at Oklahoma State School of Journalism.</p> 
<p>Lamarque was a long-time member of the Society of Illustrators, Society of Art Directors, the Dutch Treat Club, National Press Club, and New York University Club. He was also an amateur magician and member of the Society of American Magicians. He performed magic acts for the annual Christmas party of the Society of Illustrators. Abril Lamarque died in 1999 at the age of 94.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Abril Lamarque papers date from 1883-2001, with the bulk of the material ranging from 1904-1999, and measure 6.2 linear feet. The collection documents the life and career of Cuban-born cartoonist, designer, illustrator, graphic artist, caricaturist, and art director Abril Lamarque through printed materials, scrapbooks, writings, and original artwork. Found are files and numerous examples of his design work for the <emph render="italic">New York World-Telegram and Evening Mail</emph>, the <emph render="italic">New York Daily News</emph>, the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, <emph render="italic">US News-World Report</emph>, Dell Publishing Company, and others; cartoons and caricatures by Lamarque; files regarding his writings and workshops and his memberships in various organizations. Lamarque's life-long interest in, and amateur performances of, magic are also documented to a lesser extent.</p> 
<p>The collection consists primarily of varied printed material (1883-1989), such as magazines, newspapers, clippings, posters, and other publications that Lamarque either designed or that feature his cartoons, caricatures, or illustrations. These include clippings of the comic strip <emph render="italic">Monguito</emph> and editions of the Havana newspaper <emph render="italic">Lunes de Diario de Cuba</emph>.</p>  
<p>Printed material also includes posters, some humorous and others more serious, such as the posters Lamarque designed for the "Aluminum for Britian" project which he was asked to discontinue by the U.S. State Department. Seven scrapbooks (1920-1959) containing clippings and articles, illustrations, scattered letters, photographs, invitations, artwork, and other materials detailing Lamarque's extensive artistic career and his amateur magic performances are also found within the collection.</p> 
<p>In addition, the collection includes biographical information;  scattered correspondence (1922-1990) and financial records (1924-1962); published and unpublished writings and lectures (1925-1999) in the form of book reviews, lectures, articles on publication design, and a typewritten manuscript Lamarque wrote in the late 1970s on the principles of publication design; original artwork such as caricatures, pencil sketches, and illustrations by Abril Lamarque, his brother Juan Abril Lamarque, and other artists; and numerous photographs (1924-1986) documenting Lamarque's private and professional life. Also found are files on Abril Lamarque Creations (1940-1945), a design studio owned by Lamarque focusing on the design and manufacture of modern decorative accessories for the home, such as serving trays, cigarette holders and jewelry. Lamarque also designed small airmail labels and sold them through Woolworth's discount stores in the 1940s.</p>  
<p>The collection includes several subject files (1904-1996) concerning the Barcardi company, for which Lamarque designed a company logo and annual reports, the Dell Publishing Company, and Cuban caricaturist and publisher Conrado Massaguer. The material on Massaguer includes a rare 1933 edition of the New York weekly magazine, <emph render="italic">Knickerbocker Jr.</emph>, filled with Massaguer's illustrations, several covers of his celebrated magazine <emph render="italic">Social</emph>, published in Havana between the years 1916 and 1938, and pages from the &#x201C;Ellos&#x201D; section of <emph render="italic">Social</emph>, a segment that included Massaguer's caricatures of prominent members of Cuban high society. Included is a large color poster of one of Massaguer's most famous caricatures, &#x201C;Doble Nueve,&#x201D; with a handwritten dedication inscribed on the right. The Subject Files also include materials collected about  Mexican caricaturist Ernesto Garc&#x00ED;a, self-taught Polish painter Karol Kozlowski, and several other illustrators and political figures of interest to Lamarque.</p>
