<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Realist painter Thomas Eakins was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1844.  He was encouraged by his parents to develop his talent in art, and in 1862 he entered the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  Also during this period Eakins developed an interest in anatomy, revealed later in the realistically detailed <emph render="italic">Gross Clinic</emph>, painted in 1875.  In 1866 he moved to Paris, where he studied painting with Jean-Léon Gérôme at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts for three years, and briefly with sculptor Augustin-Alexandre Dumont and painter Léon Bonnat.  He toured Spain for six months in 1870 and then returned to Philadelphia to become a portrait artist.  Eakins began teaching at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and became its director of instruction in 1882.  During this period he also met fellow artist Susan MacDowell and they were married in 1884.  While at the Academy, he promoted a curriculum based on the study of the human figure, and began using photography as a method of study for his paintings.  A dispute over the use of nude models forced Eakins to resign from the Academy in 1886, but he continued painting and exhibiting until his death in 1916.</p>

<p>Letters to his family include letters to his mother, father, future brother-in-law William ("Bill") Crowell, youngest sister Caroline ("Caddy"), and numerous letters to his younger sister Frances ("Fanny") Eakins Crowell.  In the letters Eakins discusses his life in Paris, European political events such as the attempt to assassinate Emperor Alexander of Russia and rioting in Paris, working in Jean-Léon Gérôme's studio, and his opinions on Gérôme's artwork, including in a letter a sketch of the painting <emph render="italic">Dante</emph> (April 1, 1869).   He also discusses  Frederick DeBourg Richards and Thomas Couture, as well as his friendship with artist William ("Bill") Sartain who was also living in Paris at the time, and Fanny's friendship with Emily Sartain, also an artist.  Also found is a photographic copy of a November 8, 1866 illustrated letter to his mother.  Most of the letters are fragments with pages missing, and almost all include transcripts.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous letters include photographic copies of a fragment of an illustrated letter from artist Charles Lewis Fussell to Eakins, three letters from Eakins to former student John Laurie Wallace, and one letter, dated 1934, to Mr. Wallace from Susan Eakins, all transcribed.  Also found are photocopies of three letters from Eakins to William ("Bill") Hallowell, a friend and portrait subject. </p>
