<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>While in Chicago to advise and work on the fine arts section of the
1893 World's Columbian Exposition, architects Charles F. McKim, Daniel Burnham,
and Richard Howland Hunt, painters John La Farge and Frank Millet, and
sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and Daniel Chester French, among others, met
regularly. From their collaborative experience and discussions came the idea
for an American school for artists in Europe. Charles F. McKim was especially
enthusiastic. He strongly believed that collaborative experience should be
available to future American artists, and perceived a real need for an American
school in Europe--preferably in Rome, the very best place to study art, in his opinion.</p> 
<p>By March of the following year, McKim was busy devising plans for the
school and persuading like-minded architects and artists to assist. He proposed
to finance the school by convincing institutions with traveling scholarships in
the arts to send those students to Rome. Columbia University, University of
Pennsylvania, and the Rotch Scholarship fund readily agreed to the scheme, and
in ensuing years many others followed suit. In October, 1894, the American
School of Architecture in Rome opened temporary quarters in the Palazzo
Torlonia. The school consisted of its Director, Austin Lord, three fellows, and
a visiting student; its "library" contained but one volume.</p> 
<p>A move to the larger, more suitable Villa Aurora occurred in July
1895. Rent from two subtenants (the newly established American School of
Classical Studies in Rome and the British and American Archaeological Society
Library in Rome), along with a personal contribution from McKim, made this
financially feasible.</p> 
<p>The American School of Architecture in Rome was incorporated in the
State of New York, 1895, and 10 shares of capital stock were issued. Despite
substantial fundraising efforts in Chicago, New York, and Boston, severe
financial problems continued. The American School of Classical Studies in Rome
vacated the Villa Aurora in 1896--and with it went a sizeable portion of the
School of Architecture's income. McKim frequently made up the deficit from his
own pocket.</p> 
<p>Eventually, it was decided that the American School of Architecture in
Rome must be reorganized along the lines of the French Academy and that
national sponsorship needed to be obtained through an act of Congress. In June
of 1897, the American School of Architecture in Rome voted to dissolve itself
and create the American Academy in Rome. The new institution would assume all
assets and obligations, fellowships in painting and architecture were to be
added to the program, and its Board of Trustees would include architects and
artists. The Academy is not a school. Its fellows and visiting students,
already professionally trained, go to Rome for further development and for
collaboration and association with others. In the words of Director Gorham
Phillips Stevens: "The object of the American Academy in Rome is not to afford
opportunities for a few individuals to perfect themselves for the practice of
their chosen professions. The ideal is to create an atmosphere in which a
limited number of carefully selected artists and scholars may develop that
synthesis of intellectual culture which will make them worthy to preserve and
continue the great traditions of the past in order that the standard of art and
literature may be handed on from year to year, constantly strengthened and
improved."</p> 
<p>Beginning in 1901, bills to make the American Academy in Rome a
"national institution" were introduced in Congress on several occasions. A
hearing was finally scheduled in 1905, and a revised bill that prohibited
government funding and specified that U.S. officials may not be Trustees was
signed into law. Serious efforts to create an Endowment Fund and secure better
quarters were associated with the movement to obtain status as a national
institution. The Academy was successful in meeting all of these objectives. In
1904, the Academy moved to the Villa Mirafiore (also known as Villa Mirafiori), which it soon purchased and
renovated. The Endowment Fund raised well over a million dollars. Donors of
$100,000 to the Endowment Fund, designated "Founders" of the American Academy
in Rome, were: The Carnegie Foundation, Henry C. Frick, Harvard College,
Charles F. McKim, J. P. Morgan, Sr., J. P. Morgan, Jr., The Rockefeller
Foundation, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., William K. Vanderbilt, and Henry Walters.
Other categories of donors were "Incorporators" (a new Act of Incorporation was
required at the time the American Academy in Rome was chartered as a national
institution) and "Life Members."</p> 
<p>The American School of Classical Studies in Rome, which had been
established by the Archaeological Society in 1895 and during its first year
shared the Villa Aurora with the American School of Architecture in Rome,
entered into a consolidation agreement with the American Academy in Rome in
1911. Their merger went into effect on the last day of 1912, and ever since,
the American Academy in Rome has consisted of the School of Fine Arts and the
School of Classical Studies, administered by a common director. The School of
Classical Studies is composed of fellows and visiting scholars who are graduate
students, secondary teachers, or professors engaged in research in the areas of
archaeology, ancient art, philology, and humanistic studies. Women were a part
of the School of Classical Studies from its beginning, but were not permitted
to participate in the School of Fine Arts until well after World War II.
Beginning in 1923, the School of Classical Studies instituted Summer Sessions
which appealed to secondary teachers, and attracted an enrollment that was
largely female.</p> 
<p>Originally, the School of Fine Arts offered fellowships in
architecture, painting, and sculpture. Fellowships in landscape architecture
were added in 1915; in 1920, a Department of Music was established, and along
with it fellowships in musical composition. Fellowships in art history were
established in 1947. Unmarried men under age 30 were eligible to compete for
the fine arts fellowships awarded annually (except for landscape architecture,
awarded every third year); the duration of fellowships ranged from one to three
years at various points in the institution's history. In residence along with
fellows of the American Academy in Rome, might be holders of various traveling
scholarships: the McKim Fellowship, the Columbia Traveling Scholarship, the
Perkins Scholarship, the Robinson Traveling Scholarship (Harvard), the Rotch
Scholarship, the Julia Appleton Scholarship, the Traveling Scholarship and
Stewardson Memorial Scholarship (University of Pennsylvania), the Cresson
Scholarship (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts), the Drexel Institute
Traveling Scholarship, the Lazarus Scholarship (Metropolitan Museum of Art),
the Lowell Scholarship (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and the
Rinehart Scholarship (Peabody Institute, Baltimore). Visiting students, who
remained for a much briefer period than fellows or recipients of various
traveling scholarships, were admitted to all lectures and granted use the
library, but resided elsewhere. The Academy opened an Atelier in downtown Rome
for visiting students in 1927, which operated until financial considerations
forced its discontinuation seven years later.</p> 
<p>As the merger was being planned, J. P. Morgan, Sr., who was interested
in both the American Academy in Rome and the American School of Classical
Studies in Rome, began buying properties on the Janiculum, adjacent to Villa
Aureilia. Villa Aurelia, built on the summit of the Janiculum in 1650, had been
bequeathed to the American Academy in Rome in 1909 by Clara Jessup Heyland.
Complications surrounding the gift of Villa Aurelia--including the will being
contested by Mrs. Heyland's brother, and problems with unsettled tax
assessments--were overcome in the interest of acquiring the outstanding
building and its extensive grounds. Not long before his death in 1913, Morgan
donated his neighboring land, and the American Academy in Rome continued to
expand its Janiculum holdings through purchases and gifts from others. Morgan
also agreed to provide a loan for construction of a new building. This
building, designed by McKim, Mead, and White and known as the Main Building or
Academy Building, opened in 1915; it served as the fellows' residence and work
area, and included room for the library, offices, and space for exhibitions and
other public events.</p> 
<p>During World War I, the American Academy in Rome managed to remain
open, although no new fellows arrived during the war years and the number of
resident fellows and staff dwindled considerably. Most who remained were
involved in some type of civilian war work, often with the Red Cross. In fact,
Villa Aurelia was rented by the Red Cross in Italy for office space, and the
Main Building was offered as a convalescent hospital, but the war ended before
it could be put to that use.</p> 
<p>After Italy declared war on the United States in 1941, the American
Academy in Rome closed for the remainder of World War II. Those who had been
awarded fellowships in classics just prior to the Academy's closing were given
the option of using their stipends for study at home or waiting until
conditions permitted travel to Rome. A very reduced staff stayed to care for
the property and continue library cataloguing, coping with often severe wartime
shortages of food and fuel. In addition, there were financial hardships. When
bank accounts of enemy aliens were frozen and it was no longer possible to
transfer funds from the United States, the Swiss Legation and Vatican arranged
for loans to keep the Academy and its staff afloat. Funds that would have been
awarded to new fellows during this period were put to use in other ways. In
1943, the American Academy in Rome made a grant to the Citizen's Committee for
the Army and Navy, Inc. for competitions to award commissions to artists and
art students throughout the country, funding more than 100 triptychs for
chapels, as well as murals, medals, and sculpture. Seniors in American colleges
and universities were eligible to compete for several scholarships for graduate
work in classical studies awarded by the American Academy in Rome. </p> 
<p>In 1945, the Academy was the site of Leave Courses on various aspects
of Italian culture offered to servicemen. From the end of the war until the
Academy reopened at the start of the 1946/47 academic year, G.I. Fellowships
were offered to discharged soldiers wishing to study at the Academy, making the
institution eligible to receive surplus equipment and rations. During this time
intensive planning was underway for administrative changes and new programs.

applications and examination questions, and the proposed consolidation
agreement. Treasurers' records include the files of Alex. Bell and Willard V.
King. Bell's sparse records consist of a budget, receipts for salary payments,
an invoice, canceled checks, and correspondence. King's files, while more
substantial than those that survive from Bell's tenure, are quite incomplete.
They include correspondence, banking records, budgets and financial statements,
investment records, invoices, and receipts for salaries and expenses.</p> 
<p><emph render="bold">Series 2: Board of Trustees Records, </emph>is
comprised of legal documents, minutes, and reports; records of Trustee
committees; records of officers; and records of individual Trustees. Legal
documents, 1897-1926 and undated, consist of by-laws and amendments,
certificate of incorporation, and constitution and amendments. Minutes and
reports of the Board of Trustees, 1897-1947 and 1957, including those of its
annual meetings, are carbon copies rather than the official minute books, and
are incomplete. Reports of officers are incomplete, as well. Also included are
reports of Officers'/Trustees' visits to Rome, and reports of the Director and
Secretary in Rome submitted to the Board of Trustees. </p> 
<p>Records of Trustee committees, 1905-1946 and undated, consist of
reports and/or minutes arranged alphabetically by committee; these, too are
incomplete, with many committees represented by a single report. Committees
represented are: Building Committee, Carter Memorial Committee, Endowment
Committee, Executive Committee, Finance Committee, Library Committee, McKim
Memorial Committee, Nominating Committee, Committee on Publications. Committee
on the School of Classical Studies records consist of its own minutes and
reports, reports of its Advisory Council and the Jury on Classical Fellowships.
Committee on the School of Classical Studies also include reports of officers
and staff of the School of Classical Studies to the Committee on the School of
Classical Studies as follows: Director, Professor in Charge, Annual Professor,
Director of the Summer Session, Professor of Archaeology, Curator of the
Museum, Editor, Librarian, and Committee on the Welfare of Women Students.
Committee on the School of Fine Arts records consist of its own minutes and
reports, reports of its Special Committee on the Plan and Expense of a
Department of Music in the School of Fine Arts, and report of Fine Arts
Program, Triptych Project with the Citizens Committee for the Army and Navy,

Presidents Theodore N. Ely, George B. McClellan, and Henry James; Secretaries
H. Siddons Mowbray (Secretary/Treasurer), Frank D. Millet, C. Grant La Farge,
William B. Dinsmoor, and H. Richardson Pratt; and Treasurers William R. Mead,
William A. Boring, Leon Fraser, and Lindsay Bradford Office files of President
Mead, Secretaries Millet and La Farge, and Treasurer Boring are the most
complete; files of other individuals, the Vice Presidents in particular, are
often quite sparse.</p> 
<p>Records of individual Trustees, 1902-1946 and undated, consist of
material relating to official Academy business that was created or maintained
by each in his capacity as trustee. (Note: many of these individuals also
served as officers or staff of the Academy, and their records documenting those
functions will be found in the appropriate series.) Included in this subseries
are the records of: Chester H. Aldrich, Gilmore D. Clarke, James C. Egbert,

<head>Provenance</head>
<p>The academy donated the records of its predecessor institutions
(American School of Architecture in Rome and American School of Classical
Studies in Rome), selected Board of Trustees records, and New York office files
to the Archives of American Art in 1982. An additional gift of Rome office
records, including personal papers of director Gorham Phillips Stevens, was
received in 1990. Prior to receiving these donations, the Archives of American
Art borrowed printed matter of the academy, 1911-1964, for microfilming in 1965
(microfilm reels ITRO 2-3 and ITRO 11-13); very few of the items microfilmed in
1965 were among the records subsequently donated.</p>

<head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The collection was processed and the finding aid written by Catherine S. Gaines in 2001. The finding aid
was revised by Stephanie Ashley in September 2001 prior to EAD conversion. The
size of this collection was reduced dramatically after large numbers of carbon
copies and other duplicates were weeded and containers packed more tightly to
provide adequate physical support for the papers. It was obvious that before
they came to the Archives of American Art the records had been rearranged more
than once, and in such a way that materials from many different departments had
been intermingled. In keeping with archival theory and practice, the records
were organized to reflect the structure and operation of the institution that
created the records, making them more understandable and accessible to a wide
variety of researchers.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>The idea for a school for American artists in Europe was
discussed by a group of architects, painters, and sculptors who met in Chicago
while collaborating on the fine arts section of the 1893 World's Columbian
Exposition. Its most enthusiastic proponent was architect Charles F. McKim who
worked tirelessly to make the concept a reality. He was its main administrator,
and often kept the school afloat financially with infusions of cash from his
personal account. In 1897 it was decided to reorganize as an academy, and the
American School of Architecture in Rome was legally dissolved and replaced by
the American Academy in Rome.</p> 
<p>This subseries include records of the school's managing
committee, correspondence, financial records, and printed matter. Among the
managing committee's records are notes and correspondence relative to the
founding of the institution; minute books which include a semi-annual report of
the executive committee managing committee, copies of printed competition
announcements, and an engrossed copy with a transcription of dissolution
documents; and legal documents including records concerning the school's
dissolution in 1898 prior to being reorganized as the American Academy in Rome,
an 1895 certificate of the secretary to the bank, and the 1895 lease for the
Villa Aurora. Correspondence is mostly that of Charles F. McKim (Vice President
1894-1895 and President 1895-1896) who handled administrative matters. Capital
Stock Certificates, 1895, include an "Original Issues of Shares" list.</p>

<unittitle>American School of Classical Studies in Rome, 
<unitdate>1895-1913</unitdate></unittitle> 
</did> 
<scopecontent> 
<p>The extant records of the American School of Classical Studies
in Rome consist mainly of printed matter and financial records that were
transferred to the Secretary of the American Academy in Rome by the
Columbia-Knickerbocker Trust Co., New York. Other records related to the early history of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome are located in the archives of the Archaelogical Institute of America, Boston.</p> 
<p>This subseries includes records of the school's managing
committee and of the committee on fellowships; publications; printed matter;
and treasurers' records. The managing committee file consists of the preamble
and proposed resolution concerning the school's merger with the American
Academy in Rome. Annual reports of the medieval and renaissance studies
committee includes extracts from the <emph render="italic">Bulletin of the
Archaeological Institute of America </emph>and the <emph
render="italic">Journal of the Archaeological Institute of America,
</emph>fellowship applications, examination questions, and the proposed
consolidation agreement. Treasurers' records include the files of Alex. Bell
and Willard V. King. Bell's records are sparse and King's files, while more
substantial than those that survive from Bell's tenure, are also
incomplete.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>Files of secretaries Frank D. Millet (1.9 linear feet) and his
successor C. Grant La Farge (2.0 linear feet) contain no obvious gaps. Millet's
files include scattered correspondence of assistant W. R. Wolfe; the content of
La Farge's records shifts after 1919, with the advent of an executive secretary
in the New York office who tended to the more routine administrative matters
(see Series 3). La Farge's files include the correspondence of assistant
secretaries W. R. Wolfe and Frank B. Rowell. Records of earlier and later
secretaries, H. Siddons Mowbray, William B. Dinsmoor, and H. Richardson Pratt,
are very sparse with only a few folders for Mowbray and Pratt and, in
Dinsmoor's case, three items.</p> 
</scopecontent> 
<arrangement>
<p>Records are arranged chronologically by secretary with the
names of the secretary at the top of each file group indicated in bold type.
Within the file group for each secretary, general correspondence files are
followed by other files arranged alphabetically by subject or by name of the
person to whom the file relates.</p>

<p>Since its founding the American Academy in Rome has maintained
offices in New York. This office supports the work of the board of trustees and
its many committees, and is responsible for administration of fellowship
competitions, fundraising, and record keeping.</p>

<unittitle>Records of Staff,

</did> 
<scopecontent> 
<p>Records of staff include the office files of executive
secretaries Roscoe Guersney, Meriwether Stuart, and Mary T. Williams; librarian
George K. Boyce; and endowment fund campaign secretaries Phillilps B. Robinson
and Edgar I. Williams.</p> 
<p>The executive secretary, based in New York, handled nearly all
routine administrative matters. Records of this office (8 linear feet) are
mainly those of Roscoe Guernsey (7.33 linear feet), who held the post from 1919
to 1946; they represent the most extensive and comprehensive set of files among
all of American Academy in Rome records. Prior to 1919, this type of
information is found among the records kept by the Secretary and, to a slightly
lesser extent, the president. Records of two later executive secretaries,
Meriwether Stuart and Mary T. Williams, are less comprehensive (each 0.33
linear feet).</p> 
<p>Other staff records are those of the librarian (2 folders) and
endowment fund campaign secretaries (0.25 linear ft.). Although the library and
its staff are based in Rome, records of George K. Boyce (former fellow in
classical studies who was appointed librarian in 1939) are placed with those of
the New York office staff because they are from the period when the academy was
closed during the Second World War and all correspondence concerning library
matters was addressed to him at the academy's New York office.</p> 
</scopecontent> 
<arrangement>
<p>Records of the executive secretaries are first in the series,
followed by the files of the librarian and the endowment fund campaign
secretaries. For each individual correspondence files are followed by files
arranged alphabetically by subject or name of the person to whom the file
relates.</p>

<p>This subseries (0.75 linear feet) consists of printed forms
filled out by fellows and visiting students indicating biographical
information, academic and professional background, and dates in attendance.
Many include attachments, usually letters, requesting a recommendation or
verification of attendance, with occasional news clippings. The correspondende
indicates that these files were maintained simultaneously by the secretary and
executive secretary, probably as a reference file. Some forms, especially those
from the period when the institution was the American School of Architecture in
Rome, are copies made many years later and contain the notation: "Please fill
out and return. May 1, 1914."</p>

<p>These records (0.66 linear ft.) were donated to the American
Academy in Rome from various sources or otherwise left on its premises. None
are official records generated by the institution and some predate the
institution. Included are: Ernest Lewis' photograph album/scrapbook; Allan
Marquand's papers; Charles F. McKim's memorabilia, photographs, printed matter,
and artifacts; Charles R. Morey's correspondence; and Elihu Vedder's Bible.</p>

<p>Ernest Lewis, fellow in architecture, was at the American
Academy in Rome, circa 1908-1911. Little is known of him other than that he
practiced architecture in New York. The Ernest Lewis scrapbook, included in
this subseries, includes photographs of Lewis and his fellow students (many
identified, most likely at a later date), circa 1908-1911; interior views of
Mirafiore and Lewis in Egypt; photographs of architectural renderings and
drawings of architectural details (some by Lewis, others unsigned); clippings
and printed matter about architecture, including illustrations of a
prize-winning work, and articles about French architects Constant Désiré
Despradelle and Jean Louis Pascal; photographs and reproductions of
architectural renderings of Roman buildings and entries in various
architectural competitions; a McKim, Mead &#38; White label [possibly a
bookplate]; a reprint from <emph render="italic">The Technology Review</emph>,
November 1912, of an article about Constant Désiré Despradelle; "Rome Letter,"
1913 and undated, by George S, Koyle, Fellow in Architecture, American Academy in
Rome; and an article about Jean Louis Pascal from <emph render="italic">Journal
of the American Institute of Architects</emph>, circa 1913.</p> 
<p>Allan Marquand (1853-1924) was professor of art history and
archaeology at Princeton University, from 1883 until his death in 1924. Between
1896 and 1897 he served as a professor in the School of Classical Studies in
Rome. From approximately 1909 to 1923, he chaired the annual meeting of the
Committee on Medieval and Renaissance Studies of the Archaeological Institute
of America, a committee which originated in the School of Classical Studies.
Papers relating to Marquand and included in this subseries were given to the
American Academy in Rome by Miss Lucy Shoe, who had received the materials from
the Marquand family. </p> 
<p>Charles Follen McKim (1847-1909), after studying at Harvard, and
the Ecole des Beaux Arts, and working in the offices of H. H. Richardson, in
1879 formed the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White. After meeting
other architects and artists at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in
Chicago and discussing with them the advantages of studying art in Europe,
McKim proposed the idea for a school in Europe for American artists. From this
plan emerged the American School of Architecture in Rome which eventually
became the American Academy in Rome. In addition to being a founder, McKim
served as trustee, treasurer, and president; in the early days, McKim's
determined service and financial help were responsible for the institution's
continued existence. Acquisition documents relating to McKim's files are
contained in this subseries and include an itemized list of the gift, labeled
as follows: "Documents, property of Mr. McKim, which were brought from Mr.
Smith's office by Mr. Dolan (21/8/47) to be left with record in A.A.R. office
(in small black case in closet)." Items 10, 11, 12 (case of drawing
instruments, 18" ruler, and sketch by unknown artist) were not among the
materials received from the American Academy in Rome by the Archives of
American Art.</p> 
<p>Charles R. Morey (1877-1965) was a professor of art and
archaeology at Princeton University, a fellow at the American School of
Classical Studies in Rome in 1903, and professor of classical studies at the
American Academy in Rome from 1925 to 1926. From 1945 to 1947, Morey served as
Acting Director, and later Director of the American Academy in Rome. Morey's
correspondence is included in this subseries.</p> 
<p>Mural painter Elihu Vedder (1836-1923), a resident of Rome, was
affiliated with the firm of McKim, Mead and White during a stay in America from
1897 to 1898. Nothing is known of the circumstances under which the Elihu
Vedder Bible, included in this subseries, became the property of the
academy.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>This subseries consists primarily of the office files of the
Rome office directors but also contains four folders of records of the School
of Fine Arts faculty. The records document the administration of the School of
Fine Arts, the School of Classical Studies, and their facilities in Rome. The
most extensive and complete files are those of Gorham Phillips Stevens (1.25
linear feet). Records of other directors, H. Siddons Mowbray, George Breck,
Jesse Benedict Carter, James Monroe Hewlett, Chester H. Aldrich, Amey Aldrich,
Charles R. Morey, and Laurance P. Roberts, are quite incomplete and range in
size from 1 folder to 0.5 linear feet.</p> 
<p>H. Siddons Mowbray's correspondence includes letters to McKim
about the Villa Aurora, expenses, exhibition, and the King and Queen attending
the academy opening; a letter from Charles Keck about his studio; and
correspondence concerning endowment fundraising.</p> 
<p>George Breck's correspondence includes a letter to Secretary
Millet about appraisal of the Villa Mirafiore and Madam Loyson's idea of
starting a girls' school in Rome that would be a branch of the American Academy
in Rome. It also includes letters from Rockefeller's secretary declining to
participate in the academy's proposed endowment.</p> 
<p>General correspondence of Jesse Benedict Carter concerns
competitions, use of the terms "fellowship" and "scholarship," an exhibition,
Committee on the School of Classical Studies business, a request for extension
of fellowship time, and activities of fellows. Endowment fundraising
correspondence concerns Carter's lecturing activities on behalf of the
academy's endowment fund and appeals to individuals for contributions. A folder
concerning the Villa Mirafiore contains correspondence regarding an agreement
to use the Villa Mirafiore as a hospice for mutilated Italian soldiers.</p> 
<p>Gorham Phillips Stevens Stevens served as director in 1912.
During Carter's tenure as director, from 1913 to 1917, Stevens was director of
the School of Fine Arts and served as acting director during Carter's frequent
absences. He was acting director following Carter's death in 1917, and in 1919
became the director. His general correspondence includes "Suggestions for the
Management of the Academy during the absence of the Director in America;"
correspondence about a proposed publication; requests for museum passes;
letters of introduction; inquiries about fellowship competitions; travel
arrangements; letters concerning shipment of art work, concerns about war
conditions, and Daniel Chester French's opinion of the proposed purchase of an
enlarging machine for the sculptors; George Breck's comments on prices set by
artists for their work; and letters concerning summer school, housing for
women, the possibility of McKim's daughter giving his medals and diplomas to
the academy, and the trustees decision to inaugurate a new educational policy
under a new director.</p> 
<p>There is one folder of material relating to Amey Aldrich, sister
of Chester H. Aldrich, who acted as an assistant and official hostess during
his tenure, and probably served as acting director for a brief time following
Mr. Aldrich's death. The folder includes a report on the administrative
situation of the academy, ideas about closing the academy during World War II,
and evaluation of staff. Material also concerns repairs to buildings, staffing,
and receipts for academy funds held by Chester Aldrich and returned after his
death.</p> 
</scopecontent> 
<arrangement>
<p>Records of the directors comprise the bulk of the subseries and
are first in the subseries. Records of faculty members Frank P. Fairbanks and
Felix Lamond are at the end of the subseries. Director and faculty member names
are indicated in bold at the top of each file group.</p>
<p>File groups for each individual begin with any general
correspondence and are then arranged alphabetically by subject or name of
individual to whom the file relates.</p>
