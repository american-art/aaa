            <p>Minimal processing included arrangement to the series and folder levels. Generally, items within folders were simply verified with folder titles, but not arranged further. Folders within boxes were not numbered. The collection was rehoused in archival containers and folders, but not all staples and clips were removed.</p>

            <p>Anthony Palumbo (1922-2008) was a painter and instructor at the Art Students League of New York. Born in Italy, Palumbo immigrated to the United States in 1929. During the Depression he attended art classes in New Jersey and apprenticed with well-known W.P.A. artists. In the army during World War II, Palumbo served as a radio technician and produced cartoons on GI life for Army publications.</p>
            <p>Palumbo then studied at the Art Students League of New York and the New School for Social Research with artists such as Reginald Marsh and Stuart Davis. He also studied privately with Hans Hofmann and Burne Hogarth, working as a cartoonist to sustain his fine artwork. His cartoons were published in the 
                <emph render="italic">Chicago Tribune</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">The Philadelphia Inquirer</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Collier's</emph> magazine. In the 1950s he traveled to Mexico, where he assisted muralist Rufino Tamayo. Returning to New York, he established a studio and continued to paint until 1960 when he lost his artwork in a catastrophic studio fire. That same year Palumbo was included in the Whitney Museum's annual presentation of contemporary art.</p>
            <p>The next years were difficult for Palumbo, but in 1968 he started teaching at the Art Students League of New York, where he remained a highly regarded and well liked teacher until his death at age 85.</p>
            <p>Palumbo was married to Phyllis Malinow, also an artist.</p>

                    <p>There are two black and white snapshots of Palumbo at an event and four photocopied photographs of him in his studio teaching. The remaining photographs are of drawings and diagrams of the figure with notes, also probably used for classroom teaching. Also found are a few color snapshots and digital prints of paintings.</p>
