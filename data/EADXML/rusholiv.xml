<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Olive Rush was born in Fairmount, Indiana in 1875 to a Quaker farm family of six children, and attended nearby Earlham College, a Quaker school with a studio art program.  Encouraged by her teacher, Rush enrolled in the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1890, where she stayed for two years and achieved early recognition for her work.  In 1893, Rush joined the Indiana delegation of artists to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  </p>

<p>In 1894, she moved to New York City and continued her studies at the Art Students League with Henry Siddons Mowbray, John Twachtman, and Augustus St. Gaudens.  She secured her first job as an illustrator with Harper and Brothers and quickly started doing additional illustration work for <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping, Scribner's, The Delineator, Woman's Home Companion, Sunday Magazine,</emph> and <emph render="italic">St. Nicholas Magazine</emph>.  Rush also became a staff artist at the <emph render="italic">New York Tribune</emph> and illustrated several books.  </p>

<p>In 1904, Rush sent an inquiry with samples of her work to master illustrator Howard Pyle, who had established what was then the only school of illustration in the country in Wilmington, Delaware.  There he provided free instruction to a small number hand-picked artists culled from hundreds of applicants.  Although Pyle did not admit women to his studio, he encouranged her to come and join the class for lectures and criticisms.  Rush moved to Delaware later that year, joining a growing number of female illustrators there including Ethel Pennewill Brown (later Leach), Blanche Chloe Grant, Sarah Katherine Smith, and Harriet Roosevelt Richards, among others.  Rush and her female colleagues lived together in a boarding house known as Tusculum, which became well-known as a gathering place for women artists.</p>

<p>Rush traveled to Europe in 1910, embarking on a period of intense study and travel which would mark a steady transition from illustration to painting.  She studied at Newlyn in Cornwall, England and then in France with the American impressionist Richard E. Miller.  She returned to Wilmington in 1911, where she moved into Pyle's studio with Ethel Pennewill Brown.  Rush bounced to New York, Boston, and back to France, where she lived for a time with fellow artists Alice Schille, Ethel Pennewill Brown, and Orville Houghton Peets.   Her reputation grew, and she began to exhibit regularly in major national and regional juried exhibitions including the Carnegie, Pennsylvania Academy, and Corcoran annual exhibitions, as well as the Hoosier Salon.</p>

<p>In 1914, Rush made her first trip to Arizona and New Mexico. Passing through Santa Fe on her return trip, Rush made contact with the artists community at the Museum of New Mexico, where she secured an impromptu solo exhibition after showing her new work, inspired by the landscape of the Southwest. She made Santa Fe her permanent home in 1920 in an adobe cottage on Canyon Road, which became a main thoroughfare of the Santa Fe artists' community. </p>

<p>Rush began to experiment with fresco painting, and developed her own techniques suitable to the local climate.  She became a sought-after muralist and was asked to create frescoes for many private homes and businesses.  In her painting, she often depicted the Native American dances and ceremonies she attended.  She exhibited these paintings around the country, including with the Society of Independent Artists in New York, and in the Corcoran Annual Juried exhibition, where Mrs. Herbert Hoover and Duncan Phillips both purchased her work.</p>

<p>In 1932, Rush was hired to teach at the Santa Fe Indian School.  Rush's enthusiastic work in the 1930s with the young pueblo artists is credited with helping to bring about a flourishing of Native American visual art in New Mexico.  Rush continued to work with native artists throughout her life, and many of her associates went on to gain national reputations, including Harrison Begay, Awa-Tsireh, Pop Chalee, Pablita Valerde, and Ha-So-De (Narciso Abeyta).</p>

<p>From 1934 to 1939, Rush executed murals for the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and the Federal Art Project (FAP) of the Works Progress Administration (WPA).  Rush's federal art projects included murals for the Santa Fe Public Library (1934), the Biology Building of the New Mexico Agricultural College (1935), the Pawhuska, Oklahoma Post Office (1938), and the Florence, Colorado Post Office (1939).  Rush was also asked to join the Advisory Committee on Indian Art created by the PWAP in 1934, to help administer a segment of the program aimed at employing Native American artists.</p>

<p>In her later years, Rush's artwork became increasingly experimental, incorporating the ideas of Chinese painting, Native American art, and her contemporaries, the modernists, especially Wassily Kandinsky.  She continued painting and exhibiting until 1964, when illness prohibited her from working.  She died in 1966, leaving her home and studio to the Santa Fe Society of Friends.

<scopecontent> 
<p>This series contains diaries, notes, transcripts of lectures/talks, and other writings by Olive Rush, mostly about art, aesthetics, and art techniques.  Also found are personal writings, creative writing, and writings of others.  Rush's early diaries concern her childhood, education, and early career, including her experiences at the Corcoran School in Washington, D.C. and her arrival in New York City, where she studied with Henry Siddons Mowbray and Augustus St. Gaudens.  A 1932 diary contains a daily account of her experience creating murals with young Native American artists at the Santa Fe Indian School.  Rush's talks and lectures address mostly art-related topics, including art appreciation, modern art, her own art, and Indian art.  Essays include a couple of brief, handwritten essays about Indian art.</p>

<p>Notebooks include a book labeled "Analysis" which contains compositional analyses of modern paintings, detailed notes on other art subjects, and sketches.  Two other notebooks contain records of her experiments and practices with art materials, particularly frescoes, for which she developed her own techniques suitable to the New Mexican climate.  Detailed notes are found concerning Rush's mural project for the Biology Building at the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts, a Federal Public Works of Art Project, as well as loose notes on a range of art subjects.  Miscellaneous Notes contain contact information and other personal notes.</p>

<p>Other writings are found in Series 1.  More details on the Agricultural College mural are found in 1938 correspondence with R. Vernon Hunter, and many sketches for that project are found in Artwork (Series 4). </p>

<scopecontent><p>This series contains loose sketches and drawings, sketchbooks, woodcuts, and lithographs by Olive Rush, along with a few artworks created by others.</p>

<p>Sketches and Drawings are grouped by subject matter, with those representing Rush's murals and frescoes filed separately.  There is some crossover among the subject categories, and sketches and drawings made for murals in particular are likely to be found in other categories.  Although most sketches are unidentified, murals and frescoes known to be represented here include Rush's Federal Art Project murals at the Santa Fe Public Library, the New Mexico College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts, and the Pawhuska, Oklahoma Post Office.  Also represented are privately commissioned works, including murals and frescoes created for the La Fonda Hotel of Santa Fe, the Sandia School in Albuquerque, and the homes of Florence Barrett, Cyrus McCormick, and Mary Wheelwright, among others.  Photographs of many of Rush's murals and frescoes are found in Series 7.</p>

<p>Among the other sketches and drawings are scenes of Native American reservation life, scenes from home and travel destinations, studies for Rush's illustrations, portraits, and other paintings, and abstract, non-objective drawings.  Sketches and Drawings are mostly executed in pencil, but are also found in colored pencil, charcoal, watercolor, pen and ink, crayon, and oil.</p>

<p>Sketchbooks contain a similar range of subjects and media, with sketches sometimes accompanied by notes and information about location and date of execution.  Artwork by Others includes works by Charles Barrows, Edgar Miller, Dorothy Stewart, Mootzka, Will Shuster, and Ethel Pennewill Brown Leach.  See Correspondence for prints received by Rush as greeting cards.  Additional drawings by Ethel P.B. Leach are found in Biographical Materials.

<scopecontent><p>Photographs in this series depict Olive Rush, her schools, classmates, friends, colleagues, homes, and artwork.  Class pictures include a group photograph from the Corcoran School of Art circa 1890, and from the John Herron Art Institute from 1920.  Photographs from Rush's Delaware years depict the residents of "Tusculum," a boarding house used by female artists who attended Howard Pyle's studio lectures and criticisms, and the interior of the Howard Pyle studio, where Rush lived with Ethel Pennewill Brown (later Leach) during Pyle's absence in 1911.</p>

<p>The bulk of photographs of artwork depict Rush's murals in the Midwest and Southwest, some in private residences and businesses, and others created for the Federal Art Project in public facilities.  A series of photographs also depict Rush working with local Navajo, Taos, and Apache artists on frescoes at Maisel's Indian Trading Post in Albuquerque
</p>

<p>Dates given in parentheses are execution dates of artwork and should not be confused with record dates.  Apart from installation views, murals, and frescoes, photographs of artwork have not been digitized.</p> </scopecontent>
