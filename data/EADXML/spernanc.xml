            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Nancy Spero (1926-2009) was a figurative painter, printmaker, and collage artist in New York City whose multi-media work often incorporated text. She was an ardent feminist and activist whose political and social concerns were expressed in her art.</p>
            <p>Born in Cleveland, Nancy Spero lived in Chicago from the time she was a very young child until completing her studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (BFA 1949) where she met her future husband, painter Leon Golub (1922-2004). She studied briefly in Paris and lived in New York City, returning to Chicago after her marriage in 1951. The couple and their two sons lived in Italy from 1956 to 1957. In 1959, after a few years in New York, the family moved to Paris where Spero developed an interest in existentialism and produced a series of black paintings. When Spero and Golub returned to New York in 1964, their family consisted of three sons.</p>
            <p>Nancy Spero was strongly affected by the war in Vietnam and the many social changes of the period. She became a social activist and feminist, joined various organizations, and participated in a variety of demonstrations. Work such as the 
                <emph render="italic">War</emph> series began to include political and sexual imagery. Spero was among the founding members of the women's cooperative A.I.R. Gallery established in 1972. In 1974 she decided to make women in mythology, history, art, and literature the exclusive subject of her work. Included in this vein are major series and installations, among them 
                <emph render="italic">Torture of Women</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Notes in Time on Women</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">The First Language</emph>, and her 66th Street/Lincoln Center subway station mosaic mural 
                <emph render="italic">Artemis, Acrobats, Divas and Dancers</emph>.</p>
            <p>Spero exhibited in the 1950 Salon des Independents and her first solo exhibition (in tandem with Leon Golub) was held at Indiana University in 1958. Thereafter, she showed sporadically until nearly 30 years later when her career flourished and she enjoyed international stature. Beginning in 1986, each year brought multiple solo exhibitions at galleries and museums in the United States and internationally. In addition, she continued to participate in group shows such as "Documenta" and the Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the permanent collections of museums throughout the world.</p>
            <p>Awards and honors included the Skowhegan Medal for Works on Paper (1995), Hiroshima Art Prize shared with Leon Golub (1996), The Women's Caucus for Art award for Outstanding Achievement in Visual Arts (2003), and The Women's Caucus for Art Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement (2005). Spero was awarded honorary Doctorates of Fine Arts by The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1991) and Williams College (2001), and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2006).</p>
            <p>After several years of declining health, Nancy Spero died from heart failure in New York City, October 18, 2009.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of photographs and color digital prints; also found are slides, some negatives, and color transparencies. Images of artwork are mostly by Spero. Photographs of artwork by others include many unsigned works as well as pieces by Traude Linhardt, Mira Schor, and Ana Mendieta. Views of exhibition installations record Nancy Spero's solo exhibitions and her participation in the 2007 "Venice Biennale, 52." People appearing in photographs are Nancy Spero, Leon Golub, their sons, grandchildren, Nancy's sister Carol Newman, and unidentified people, most likely friends. Folders titled "family" and "friends" include views in which Spero and/or Golub are present. Miscellaneous subjects are a dog and owl. One photograph album, circa 2000s, consists of pictures that appear to have been taken on the same day; included are views of Nancy Spero with friends and family.</p>
