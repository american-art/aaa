<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jerome Blum (1884-1956) was a world traveler who found artistic inspiration while living in France and traveling to the American west, Hawaii, Japan, China, Cuba, and the South Seas (including a 10 month stay in Tahiti). Blum painted landscapes and seascapes of Southern France, and the many places he visited, as well as still lifes of exotic plants and fruits.  He was living in Paris at the height of the Fauve movement and incorporated some of its ideas into his work, first inserting bold colors into his fairly conservative Post-Impressionist style. Later, he used significantly more saturated color, intense light, and bold forms.</p>

<p>Blum studied at the Francis J. Smith Art Academy in his native Chicago, and the Art Institute of Chicago. He went to Paris in 1906 with Lucile Swan, a sculptor and fellow student who eventually became his wife. There, he enrolled in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts for a brief period, studying with Luc Olivier Merson. Blum remained in Paris until 1910, participated in the 1909 and 1910 Salons d'Automne and received exhibition offers from Galerie Sagot, Paris, and Anderson Galleries, New York.  While in France, Blum knew expatriates Jo Davidson, Arthur Dove, Samuel Halpert, Alfred Maurer, and John Marin. Halpert became a mentor of sorts, instructing him in painting Post-Impressionist landscapes, to which Blum soon added Fauvist color.</p> 

<p>Once back in Chicago, Blum developed close friendships with writers Sherwood Anderson, Theodore Dreiser, and Ben Hecht that lasted for decades. His one-man show at Thurber's Art Gallery in 1911 received very mixed reviews ?? most likely it was the first time the Fauve palette was seen by Chicagoans, and most thought it too radical. When the mayor purchased a Blum painting from a 1912 Art Institute of Chicago group exhibition, the proceeds enabled Blum to visit the American west. Later that year, Blum and Lucile Swan traveled in Europe.  They were married in Paris and took an extended honeymoon, continuing to travel in France until fall of the following year.</p> 

<p>For a period of approximately 20 years, he exhibited extensively and enjoyed critical acclaim.  During his many years of foreign residence, Blum returned to the United States periodically for exhibitions and family visits. He participated in a large number of solo exhibitions and group shows in the United States and France, including: Art Institute of Chicago, Arts Club of Chicago, O'Brien Galleries, and Albert Roullier Art Galleries in Chicago; Ainslie Galleries, Brooklyn Museum, Delphic Studios, Katz Gallery, M. Knoedler and Co., Whitney Museum of American Art, and Whitney Studio Club in New York; Boston Arts Club; Galerie de la Renaissance, Paris; Montlcair Art Museum, New Jersey; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia; Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts. Blum is represented in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>  

<p>Blum returned to New York in 1924 and Lucile filed for divorce. An auction of his work was held at the Anderson Galleries that year; Augustus John, George Biddle, Chester Dale, M. Knoedler, Kraushaar Galleries, and Jo Davidson were among the successful bidders.</p>  

<p>In 1925, he married Frances Baum, a psychiatric social worker.  They settled in Dampierre, France for eight years, and during this period traveled extensively throughout the country.  Always an unconventional and fiercely independent person, Blum's mental health was fragile and deteriorated markedly in the early 1930s, during which time his painting output decreased dramatically.  They Blums spent part of 1934 at the MacDowell Colony, Petersborough, New Hampshire.  Once his fellowship was over, they moved to Key West, Florida, where Blum became increasingly disturbed.</p>   

<p>Blum was admitted to the Bloomingdale Hospital, a private psychiatric institution in White Plains, New York, in 1935.  But after being diagnosed a "hopeless case," he was transferred to a state hospital.  While hospitalized, Blum continued writing copious notes and made many appeals for release. He died at the Hudson River State Hospital, Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1956.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Jerome Blum measure 2.6 linear feet and are dated 1915-circa 1969 (bulk 1919-1935).  Biographical material, correspondence, writings and notes, printed material, artwork, and photographs document the painter's personal and professional life, and extensive travels.</p>

<p>Correspondence with friends, relatives, colleagues, publishers, galleries, museums, and collectors documents Blum's personal and professional life. An annotated list of important correspondents was supplied by his widow.</p>  

<p>Blum was an avid writer.  He published several short stories, and recorded reminiscences, thoughts, and daily events in a series of notebooks.  These notes were the basis for <emph render="italic">Life Answered</emph>, an unpublished autobiography (eventually, edited and completed by Frances Blum).  Also included are extensive notes and writings on a variety of subjects, including his extensive travels to Tahiti. Writings by other authors consist of  "critical statements about Jerome Blum" and some of Frances Blum's writings on Theodore Dreiser.</p>

<p>Some writings by Blum, including material on China and Theodore Dreiser, Blum's draft of <emph render="italic">Life Answered</emph>, and drafts of portions of <emph render="italic">Life Answered</emph> - "Father and Mother," "Journal of the Last 20 Years," "Lucile" and "Marriage and Divorce" - were loaned to AAA for microfilming and were subsequently returned to the donor.
