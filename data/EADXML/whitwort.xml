<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Thomas Worthington Whittredge (1820-1910) was born in 1820 in Springfield, Ohio.  Receiving very little formal education, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio at the age of 17 to serve as an apprentice house and sign painter.  A few years later, in his early twenties, he briefly ran a daguerreotype studio in Indianapolis, Indiana, and worked as a portrait painter in Charleston, West Virginia.</p> <p> In 1843 Whittredge decided to pursue landscape painting, and was greatly influenced by Hudson River School artist Thomas Cole.  In 1849 he traveled to Düsseldorf, Germany, to further his training at the Düsseldorf Academy.  There, he met painter Emanuel Leutze and modeled for Leutze's painting <emph render="italic">Washington Crossing the Delaware </emph> (1850).  He lived for a year in the home of landscape painter Andreas Achenbach and became friends with Carl Friedrich Lessing.  Whittredge spent the summer of 1856 sketching in Switzerland with Albert Bierstadt.  That fall Whittredge and Bierstadt moved to Rome where they were joined by fellow artists Sanford Robinson Gifford and William Stanley Haseltine.
</p><p>
Whittredge stayed in Italy until 1859 when he returned to America and settled in New York City, renting a space at Richard Morris Hunt's famous Tenth Street Studio Building, which was frequented by some of the best-known artists, writers, and actors of the time. He kept company with Jervis McEntee, Eastman Johnson, Sanford Robinson Gifford, John Ferguson Weir, and other artists of the "old guard".  Whittredge quickly became a very successful artist, adapting what he had learned in Europe to the American landscape.  He was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1860 and became a full member in 1862.  He also served as President of the National Academy of Design from 1874 to 1877.</p><p> In 1866 Whittredge went along on a government inspection tour of the Missouri Territory and was greatly inspired by the landscape.  He traveled to Colorado in 1870 with John Frederick Kensett and Sanford Gifford and, in the late 1870s,  began painting these new landscapes.  He moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey, in 1880.  In 1893 he went on a sketching trip to Mexico with fellow artist Frederic Church and continued painting into the early 1900s.  Around this time he also began writing his autobiography which he completed in 1905.  Worthington Whittredge died in 1910 at the age of 89.

<p>Biographical documents about Worthington Whittredge include  his passport from his travels throughout Europe in the 1850s, a certificate of marriage to his wife Euphemia Foot, and a National Academy of Design certificate of appreciation presented to him on his 88th birthday and signed by many members.  Also found here is Whittredge's ledger from Düsseldorf which contains many memorandums, addresses, lists of letters received, lists of his commissions (which often include small sketches of the artwork), and copies of documents such as his grandfather's will.  This series also contains a handwritten draft of Whittredge's autobiography, which he finished writing in 1905.  Additional items include a typed copy of Whittredge genealogical information, a brief letter to Whittredge from politician Nicholas Longworth, and four letters of correspondence between his daughter Euphemia Whittredge and others regarding Emauel Leutze's painting <emph render="italic">Washington Crossing the Delaware</emph>.  There are also additional notes written by E. Whittredge (probably Euphemia) about Whittredge's paintings.  Her notes also include a few photographs and reproductions of his artwork.  Of note is a photograph of an 1849 painted miniature portrait of Whittredge.</p>

<p>Six sketchbooks and loose drawings and painting studies by Worthington Whittredge primarily document scenes from his travels in the American mid-west and west, Europe, and Mexico.  An 1849 sketchbook documents his trip down the Rhine River to Düsseldorf, Germany, and includes pencil and ink sketches of the Rhine River valley, such as panoramic landscapes, architectural ruins, vegetation, and people.  The 1857-1861 sketchbook contains sketches done while in Rome, including landscapes and figure sketches.  The 1874-1897 sketchbook includes sketches and watercolors documenting his travels in Mexico in the late 1890s.  Three additional sketchbooks include sketches of landscapes, figures, vegetation, and animals.  Some of the sketches contain annotations such as the date and location.
</p><p>
Loose drawings and paintings include numerous landscape drawings by Whittredge, drawn from nature during his travels in Germany, Switzerland, and Rome in the 1850s, as well as his travels throughout the Midwest and New England during the 1860s and 1870s.  Most of the drawings are not labeled or dated.  There are several watercolor sketches of landscapes, three large drawings of the Lagio Maggiore, a lake in Italy, and several drawings and paintings of people, including Roman peasants.  Also found here are sketches of trees and miscellaneous drawings of animals and other objects.  Additionally, there are two pencil drawings, one watercolor, and one print of artwork by Wilhelm Camphausen, a Düsseldorf painter of historical scenes.

<p>This series consists of two photographs taken by M. Louise Greene of Worthington Whittredge painting in his studio, a copyprint of a carte de visite portrait of Whittredge, and four photographs of unidentified artwork.  Also found is a photograph album containing 32 autographed cartes de visite of artists, collected by Whittredge. Two photographs are unidentified.  Three photographs have been removed and only an autograph appears on the page.  Some of the photographs may have been moved to different pages within the book, and the researcher will need to verify that each photograph actually matches the autograph on the page.</p>
