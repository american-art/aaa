            <p>New York artist, critic, writer, art consultant, and curator, Walter Pach (1883-1958) was an influential promoter of modern art and was instrumental in organizing the landmark Armory Show in 1913.</p>
            <p>Walter Pach was born in New York City, July 11, 1883. His father, Gotthelf Pach, was a prominent commercial photographer who, along with his family, ran the New York firm of Pach Brothers. The company did the bulk of the photographic work for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the young Pach often accompanied his father on museum assignments. In 1903, Pach graduated from the City College of New York with a degree in art. He also studied with Robert Henri at the New York School of Art and went abroad to paint with William Merritt Chase in the summers of 1903 and 1904.</p>
            <p>In 1906 Pach presented his first art history lecture at the Westfield State Normal School in Westfield, Massachusetts.</p>
            <p>In 1907, Pach went to France and as an artist and critic moved among the Parisian avant-garde and became part of the Gertrude and Leo Stein circle. Gertrude Stein's "Portrait of Walter Pach was painted in 1908. Pach wrote extensively about modern art and through his numerous books, articles, and translations of European art texts, brought an emerging modernist viewpoint to the American public. In 1908 he wrote the first article published in America on Cézanne, and also wrote on such established artists as Claude Monet, whom he interviewed in 1908 for 
                <emph render="italic">Scribner's Magazine.</emph>.</p>
            <p>Pach organized exhibitions of contemporary art for important New York City galleries of the period, as well as the landmark exhibition of 1913, "The International Exhibition of Modern Art," commonly known as the Armory Show. Along with painters Arthur B. Davies and Walt Kuhn, he brought together leading contemporary European and American artists. Pach served with Kuhn as administrator, publicist and gallery lecturer for the Armory Show Chicago for the run of the exhibition.</p>
            <p>Pach helped to form major collections for John Quinn and Walter Arensberg. He was also instrumental in securing individual works of art for museums, such as a portrait for the Louvre Museum by American master Thomas Eakins, and Jacques-Louis David's 
                <emph render="italic">Death of Socrates </emph>for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
            <p>Pach married artist Magdalene Frohberg in February 1914, and their son Raymond was born at the end of that year. The Pachs lived primarily in New York, but spent time abroad from 1928 to 1932. Intermittently, they lived on the West Coast, where Pach taught at the University of California at Berkeley. In the 1920s he taught at the University of Mexico on a Shilling Fund grant, lecturing and writing on Native American art and developing a strong interest in Pre-Columbian art. He took an active interest in organizing exhibitions and raising money for a museum to be dedicated to the indigenous art of the Americas. In addition, he was a friend of José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera and helped organize the Mexican chapter of the Society of Independent Artists, the New York-based organization he founded in 1917 with Walter Arensberg and Marcel Duchamp.</p>
            <p>While not well known today as a painter, Walter Pach devoted much of his creative effort to painting. He considered himself both an artist and a writer, even though friends like art historian Bernard Berenson urged him to devote all his time to writing. Among his writings are monographs on a wide range of subjects, social commentary on the art world, and a book on museum structures. Among his first publications were a series of brochures produced for the 1913 Armory Show, including 
                <emph render="italic">Odilon Redon </emph>and, in the same year, 
                <emph render="italic">A Sculptor's Architecture</emph>, a book about the work of Raymond Duchamp-Villon, a close friend whom he admired greatly. In 1923, Pach wrote 
                <emph render="italic">Georges Seurat</emph>, a book later cited by art historian John Rewald as an important early text on the artist. 
                <emph render="italic">Masters of Modern Art </emph>and the monograph 
                <emph render="italic">Raymond Duchamp-Villon </emph>were published the following year, and in 1928 Pach's well-known indictment of opportunistic artists and corruption in the art world, 
                <emph render="italic">Ananias, or The False Artist</emph>, created a stir in art circles. Pach considered Vincent Van Gogh to be a seminal figure in the development of modern art and was the first historian to lecture on him in America. In 1936, he published his well-received monograph, 
                <emph render="italic">Vincent Van Gogh</emph>. His recollections of a life spent in art, 
                <emph render="italic">Queer Thing, Painting </emph>appeared in 1938. 
                <emph render="italic">Ingres</emph> was published in 1939, as well as 
                <emph render="italic">Masterpieces of Art</emph>, written for the 1939 New York World's Fair, for which Pach was exhibition director. His 
                <emph render="italic">Art Museum in America</emph>, published in 1948, called into question the relevance, responsibility, and future direction of the American art museum. He long championed the artists of Mexico and published an essay on 
                <emph render="italic">Diego Rivera </emph>in 1951 for the National Museum of Fine Arts, Mexico, for its 50-year retrospective exhibition on the artist. 
                <emph render="italic">The Classical Tradition in Modern Art</emph>, Pach's last book, was published posthumously in 1959.</p>
            <p>Pach's fluency in French, German, and Spanish allowed him to understand and interpret new avant-garde ideas developing in Europe and to translate them for an English-speaking audience. His language skills also allowed him to communicate personally with many noted artists in Europe and Mexico and to mediate between gallery dealers and museum curators on their behalf. His correspondence with major figures in 20th-century art are a fascinating and important source of information, not only about the artists themselves but about the art world in general during the first half of this century.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The papers of New York artist, critic, historian, writer, art consultant and curator Walter Pach, measure 20.8 linear feet and date from 1857-1980. The collection documents Pach's promotion of modernism through his role in the landmark 1913 Armory Show, his relationships with artists and art-world figures and his extensive writings on art. Records include biographical material, correspondence with family, friends and colleagues including noted artists, handwritten and edited versions of manuscripts by Pach, diaries and journals, business records, printed material, scrapbooks, sketchbooks and artwork by Pach and others, and photographs of Pach and his family, friends, and colleagues. The collection also includes 12 linear feet of selections from Walter Pach's library.</p>
            <p>Biographical material includes a copy of Pach's birth certificate and two passports for Walter and Magda Pach, in addition to address books, association membership cards and certificates.</p>
            <p>Correspondence is both personal and professional. Family correspondence includes letters from Pach's son, Raymond, his first wife Magdalene (Magda), and his second wife Nikifora, whom he married in 1951 following the 1950 death of Magda. General correspondence includes letters from artists including Jean Charlot, Arthur B. Davies, Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Maurice Prendergast, Diego Rivera, Morton Livingston Schamberg, John Sloan, and Jacques Villon; and other art-world figures including writers Van Wyck Brooks and Elie Faure, and Bryson Burroughs, curator of painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
            <p>The Writings series represents an extensive collection of hand-written manuscripts, typescripts, annotated drafts and notes for published and unpublished writings by Pach, including lectures, monographs such as 
                <emph render="italic">Queer Thing, Painting</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Ananias, or The False Artist</emph>, and journal and newspaper articles such as "Pierre-Auguste Renoir" (1912).</p>
            <p>Diaries and journals include one of particular note recording Pach's trip to Europe circa 1903-1904, with William Merritt Chase's class.</p>
            <p>Business records include 2 notebooks recording sales at the Armory Show in New York, Boston and Chicago, a record book with handwritten lists of paintings owned and sold by Pach in the early 1930s, and two books, one maintained by Nikifora Pach, recording pictures sold, lectures and publications by Pach from the early 1900s to the early 1960s.</p>
            <p>Printed material documents Pach's career through exhibition catalogs of Pach's solo and group exhibitions, news clippings about Pach, including reviews of his writings on art, and an almost comprehensive collection of copies of Pach's published journal and newspaper articles.</p>
            <p>Scrapbooks include a book of reviews and original letters pertaining to Pach's book 
                <emph render="italic">Ananias or the False Artist</emph>, and a scrapbook documenting Pach's activities during the 1920s which included his first one-man show at the Brummer Gallery in New York and the publication of his books 
                <emph render="italic">Masters of Modern Art</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Raymond Duchamp-Villon</emph>.</p>
            <p>Artwork inlcudes a small group of drawings and three sketchbooks by Pach. Also of note are two print portfolios published in 1947 by the Laurel Gallery which include an essay and an etching by Pach, in addition to hand-pulled prints by artists such as Milton Avery, Reginald Marsh and Joan Miro.</p>
            <p>Photographs are of Pach from childhood through to the 1950s, in addition to Magda and Raymond Pach and other family members, artists, colleagues and friends. Included are photographs of William Merritt Chase's class and Robert Henri's class at the New York School of Art, circa 1904, and photos of artists including Robert Henri, Moriye Ogihara, and Pablo Picasso. Photographs of artwork by Pach and other artists can also be found here including Mexican mural projects by José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera, and works by Antoine-Louise Barye and George Of.</p>
            <p>Selections from Pach's library include works written by or translated by Pach, and items central to Pach's interests and work.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                        <p>This series documents Pach's relationships with artists, writers, collectors, museums and other noted art-world figures throughout his life. Early letters record Pach's role in the 1913 Armory Show and the fate of various artists during World War I. Among artists who corresponded with Pach are Arthur B. Davies, Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Maurice Prendergast, Diego Rivera, Morton Livingston Schamberg, John Sloan, and Alfred Stieglitz. There are also circa 100 letters from Pach's lifelong friend, Jacques Villon and letters from Thomas Eakins's widow Susan.</p>
                        <p>Pach's role in the development of the art collections of Walter Arensberg and John Quinn is documented in letters from Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Raoul Dufy, Jean Le Roy, Georges Roualt, and Frederic C. Torrey. Also of note are letters from Bryson Burroughs, curator of painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
                        <p>Letters from art historians, critics and writers such as Bernard Berenson, Van Wyck Brooks, Elie Faure and Leo Stein document their responses to Pach's writings on art, and provide insight into the flow of avant-garde ideas from Europe and their reception abroad. These letters also provide documentation of the European and American art markets in the early twentieth century by referencing responses to, and sales of, work by individual artists.</p>

                        <p>Many of the handwritten and edited typescript versions of published and unpublished manuscripts found here are written on the backs of pages containing pencil figure studies by Pach, showing his dual concerns as an artist and writer.</p>
                        <p>The series contains the original 381 page typescript of 
                            <emph render="italic">Queer Thing, Painting</emph> with handwritten revisions; drafts of essays, and notebooks of addresses and lectures, circa 1920s-1950s, documenting classes which Pach taught at the University of California at Berkeley, Columbia University and the University of Mexico amongst others; and drafts of miscellaneous published and unpublished writings.</p>
                        <p>The series contains a 242 page bound manuscript, hand-written with illustrations and mounted photographs, entitled "A Course of Lectures on Aesthetics as Delivered by Professor Solomon Woolf and Doctor Leigh Hunt, Before the Senior Class, and as Noted by Walter Pach of Section Five."</p>
                        <p>Memoranda, fragments of writings and notes as well as a card index noting works of art can be found at the end of the series. A folder of lists includes one labeled "Fuchs Daumier" and one entitled "Collection of the Duc de Trévise, Galerie Charpentier, May 19, 1938" with art value or price.</p>

The entries include reflections on life abroad, fellow classmates Morton Livingston Schamberg and Charles Sheeler, Pach's early interest in Japonisme and active collecting of Japanese art, including prints by master

                    <p>Of particular note in this series are two record books: one in which Pach recorded sales for the Armory Show, New York beginning February 18th and ending March 15, 1913, listing the person purchasing each picture and the amount paid, and "signed off" with the inscription "OK" and the initials "JM," presumably Jerome Myers; the second in which Pach recorded sales for the Armory Show in Boston and Chicago beginning March 23 and ending April 30, 1913, also signed off by "JM."</p>
                    <p>Other items of note include an "agenda" book from 1930-1932 which contains lists of paintings owned and sold by Pach in addition to what appears to be an inventory of his belongings, including contents of the Pach apartment; and two record books containing a "record of pictures, writings and lectures," notes on "pictures sold, exchanged or presented," and a list of "places where I have lectured." The books cover the years 1903-1950s.</p>
                    <p>One folder contains consignment lists for Pach's paintings and etchings at Kraushaar Galleries and E. Weyhe in 1934.</p>
                    <p>A record book belonging to Nikifora Pach contains notes on loans and sales of pictures in the late 1950s, in addition to enclosures documenting loan and consignment transactions with Zabriskie Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art, and others in the early 1960s. Also found is a photocopy of a list of paintings belonging to Pach and given to Nikifora Pach in the 1950s.</p>
