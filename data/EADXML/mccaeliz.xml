The collection provides a vast accumulation of research data on various artists and aspects of American art, especially the early American modernists and the Federal Arts Projects. Papers include McCausland's extensive research and writing files, particularly on Marsden Hartley, E. L. Henry, Lewis Hine, George Inness, and Alfred H. Maurer. McCausland's correspondence with artists includes a substantial amount with Arthur Dove and Alfred Stieglitz. Her collaborative work with Berenice Abbott on the

Also found are general writings, subject files, files relating to exhibitions, teaching, and committees, photographs, art work, personal papers, and printed material. Additional McCausland material donated later from the estate of Berenice Abbott include biographical materials, project files, writings, and printed materials.</abstract>

            <head>Provenance</head>
            <p>Elizabeth McCausland donated the bulk of her papers in several installments from 1956 to 1961. An unknown donor, perhaps her literary executor, donated additional papers sometime after her death in 1965. It appears that McCausland originally donated her research files on Marsden Hartley, measuring 10 linear feet, to the Whitney Museum, who then lent them to the Archives for microfilming in 1966, and donated them sometime thereafter. McCausland originally donated files of newspaper clippings and offprints of her articles to the The New York Public Library, who gave them to the Archives in 1968. Additional McCausland material from the estate of Berenice Abbott was donated to the Archives in 2009.</p>

            <p>The bulk of this collection was digitized in 2008 and 2015 and is available on the Archives of American Art's website.</p>
            <p>Materials generally not scanned include some newsclippings and publications that were either too fragile or not relevant, although some publications that appeared to be of interest to her were scanned. Other items that typically were not scanned include McCausland's student records, auction catalogs, proofs and multiple drafts of published articles, copy prints and negatives of photographs made by the Archives, photographs of works of art (except for those in the catalogue raisonne files of the Marsden Hartley series), duplicate material, and any published material that is widely available elsewhere. In some cases, only the cover and title pages for publications were scanned.</p>

            <head>Processing Information</head>
            <p>Portions of the collection received a preliminary level of processing at some point after donation. Most of the material was initially microfilmed in the order it was accessioned on reels D368-D384H, 1256, D24, 3134, and D319, and some material was never microfilmed at all. The microfilm reels have been superceded by the digitized collections. Photographs by Berenice Abbott, Barbara Morgan, and Edward Weston received conservation treatment at the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts between 1985-1991. Previously microfilmed and unmicrofilmed portions were merged, arranged, and described in accordance with archival standards; and the collection was fully processed by Jennifer Meehan in 2006 and digitized in 2008 as part of the Terra Foundation for American Art Digitization Grant. Additional material received in 2009 was processed and described by Judy Ng in 2014 and scanned in 2015 with funding provided by the Terra Foundation for American Art.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Elizabeth McCausland, the art critic and writer, was born in Wichita, Kansas in 1899. She attended Smith College, receiving her Bachelor's degree in 1920 and her Master's in 1922. Beginning in 1923, she worked as a general reporter for 
                <emph render="italic">The Springfield Republican</emph> (Springfield, Massachusetts). After several years, she began to review art exhibitions and soon became an established art critic. In the course of her work, she began to develop friendships with artists, such as Alfred Stieglitz and Arthur Dove. During these early years, she also wrote poetry and designed and printed limited edition publications on her private press.</p>
            <p>McCausland moved to New York in 1935, but continued to contribute a weekly art column to 
                <emph render="italic">The Springfield Republican</emph> until it suspended publication in 1946. From the mid-1930s on, she worked primarily as a freelance writer and art critic, contributing articles to publications such as 
                <emph render="italic">Parnassas</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">The New Republic</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Magazine of Art</emph>. In the latter part of her career, her writings focused more on art history and special studies on artists.</p>
            <p>In the late-1930s, McCausland collaborated with the photographer Berenice Abbott on the Federal Art Project book, 
                <emph render="italic">Changing New York</emph>, for which she provided the text to Abbott's now-famous photographs of New York City neighborhoods, architecture, and street scenes. She studied and wrote about photography, including numerous articles on the photographer Lewis Hine (of whose work she organized a retrospective exhibition at the Riverside Museum in 1939), and was appointed to the Advisory Committee of the Museum of Modern Art's Department of Photography in 1944.</p>
            <p>McCausland went on to organize other exhibitions, including a show of contemporary work, "The World of Today" (Berkshire Museum, 1939), shows of silk screen prints (Springfield Museum of Fine Arts, March 1940 and New York State Museum, Summer 1940), and a photography show, "Photography Today" (A.C.A. Gallery, 1944). In the late 1930s, she embarked upon a study of "the status of the artist in America from colonial times to the present, with especial attention to the relation between art and patronage," which continued over twenty years (and was never completed) and for which she received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1943.</p>
            <p>In addition to her other writing, during the 1940s, McCausland carried out studies on the artists, E. L. Henry and George Inness, which resulted in exhibitions at the New York State Museum in 1942 and the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum in 1946, respectively and publications (a report on Henry and a book on Inness). From 1948 to 1949, she carried out an extensive study of the painter, Alfred H. Maurer, organizing an exhibition, "A. H. Maurer: 1868-1932," which showed at the Walker Art Center and the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1949, and publishing the biography, 
                <emph render="italic">A. H. Maurer</emph>, in 1951. In 1950, she worked as a special consultant on the American Processional exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery and as editor of the accompanying book. Shortly thereafter, she began a study of Marsden Hartley for a monograph, which was published in 1952, and she helped organize the Hartley exhibition at the University of Minnesota that same year. She continued the Hartley study on larger scale for a planned biography and catalogue raisonne; although she continued to work on it off and on for the next decade, the project was never completed.</p>
            <p>McCausland published other books, including 
                <emph render="italic">Careers in the Arts</emph> (1951), and undertook other research and consulting projects, such as photo-editing Carl Sandburg's 
                <emph render="italic">Poems of the Midwest</emph> (1946), conducting surveys of art and advertising for an article in 
                <emph render="italic">Magazine of Art</emph> and of art education for Cooper Union Art School, and contributing yearly articles on art to various encyclopedias. At different times throughout her career, she supplemented her income by taking teaching positions. She taught courses on art history at Sarah Lawrence College from 1942 to 1944 and at Barnard College in 1956, as well as courses at the Design Laboratory (1939) and the New School for Social Research (1946). She also gave numerous lectures and speeches on various art topics, and regularly participated in conferences and symposiums. Towards the end of her career, she was publishing less, but was still involved in many projects, most notably the Hartley study.</p>
            <p>McCausland was a tireless promoter of the arts, and often an advocate for artists. Even though her work was well-known among certain art circles, she never received the recognition as a writer that she deserved. Nor was she ever able to free herself from the pressure of writing for a living. Continually suffering from poor health, she died on May 14, 1965.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The papers of art critic, writer, and historian Elizabeth McCausland measure approximately 45 linear feet and date from 1838 to 1995, with the bulk of the material dating from 1920 to 1995. The collection provides a vast accumulation of data on various artists and aspects of American art, especially the early American modernists and the Federal Arts Projects. Papers include McCausland's extensive research and writing files, particularly on Marsden Hartley, E. L. Henry, Lewis Hine, George Inness, and Alfred H. Maurer. McCausland's correspondence with artists includes a substantial amount with Arthur Dove and Alfred Stieglitz. Her collaborative work with Berenice Abbott on the 
                <emph render="italic">Changing New York</emph> book and series of photographs is well-documented within the collection. Also found are general writings, subject files, files relating to exhibitions, teaching, and committees, photographs, art work, personal papers, and printed material. Additional McCausland material from the estate of Berenice Abbott include biographical materials, project files, writings, and printed materials.</p>
            <p>McCausland's personal papers consist of appointment books and engagement calendars, scrapbooks, student papers, works printed on her private press, financial records, biographical material, and scattered memorabilia, which together document other aspects of her life apart from her work. Correspondence includes incoming and outgoing letters along with enclosures, dating from McCausland's time as a journalist for 
                <emph render="italic">The Springfield Republican</emph> in the 1920s and 1930s to her time as a freelance writer, art critic, and historian (1940s-1960s) and mostly concerning professional matters. Also included is a substantial amount of correspondence with artists, particularly Arthur Dove and Alfred Stieglitz, and some personal correspondence with her mother. General writings consists primarily of copies of McCausland's speeches and lectures on various art topics in addition to her early poems (dating from the 1930s) and scattered essays and articles.</p>
            <p>The most extensive part of the collection is comprised of McCausland's research and writing files pertaining to large research and curatorial projects, such as ones on the artists Alfred H. Maurer and Marsden Hartley (which was begun by the American Art Research Council and subsequently taken over by McCausland), and one for the American Processional exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in 1950. A wide variety of smaller projects are also well-documented in the series Other Research and Writing Files, including ones on E. L. Henry, Lewis Hine, George Inness, her collaborative work with Berenice Abbott on the 
                <emph render="italic">Changing New York</emph> book and series of photographs. Numerous other artists and art topics are covered as well, such as Arthur Dove, Robert Henri, Jacob Lawrence, Charles Hawthorne, film, and photography. Files for her book 
                <emph render="italic">Careers in Art </emph>(1950), her many speaking and lecture engagements, and editing work are also found in this series. Files consist primarily of correspondence, notes, research material, manuscripts, bibliographies, photographs of works of art, completed research forms for works of art, card index files, and printed material.</p>
            <p>Also found are subject files containing printed material, scattered notes and correspondence, and photographs, which may have been used for reference and/or collected in the course of McCausland's research activities; files relating to various exhibitions organized by McCausland from 1939 to 1944, including ones of silk screen prints and modern photography; files relating to courses on art history taught by McCausland, especially the one she taught at Barnard College in 1956; and files stemming from her participation in various art organizations and committees, especially during the time period just before and during the Second World War.</p>
            <p>Printed material consists primarily of clippings and tear sheets of McCausland's newspaper articles and columns, which document her contributions to 
                <emph render="italic">The Springfield Republican</emph> from 1923 to 1946, in addition to scattered exhibition catalogs, announcements, books, and miscellaneous publications. Photographs include ones of various artists and works of art, ones from the Farm Security Administration, and ones by photographers, such as Berenice Abbott (including ones from the Federal Art Project book, 
                <emph render="italic">Changing New York</emph>), Barbara Morgan, Weegee, and Edward Weston, among others. Photographs, sometimes annotated or including notes, are scattered throughout her research files. Also included are photographs of McCausland, dating from her childhood. Art work found in the collection includes drawings, prints, and watercolors that were either given to McCausland by the artist or collected by her in the course of her work as an art critic and historian.</p>
            <p>Additional material belonging to Elizabeth McCausland and donated by the estate of Berenice Abbott includes biographical material; business and personal correspondence; professional project files and writings, including drafts and research materials related to the book projects

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Series consists of material relating to the more personal aspects of McCausland's life, including appointment books and engagement calendars, scrapbooks, student papers, works printed on her private press in Springfield, Massachusetts, financial records, biographical material, and scattered memorabilia. Scrapbooks include one kept by McCausland, dating from 1937 to 1940, comprised of correspondence from Waldo Leland Cook, Art Young, Max Weber, and Edward Sternberg, clippings, and other printed material (which was disassembled at some previous point in time and exists now as loose items); and one kept by her mother, Belle Noble McCausland, dating from 1920 to 1943, comprised mostly of clippings and empty envelopes from letters received by McCausland (letters were removed at some previous point in time and can now be found amongst correspondence). Student papers include an honors paper written while an undergraduate at Smith College and a copy of her M.A. thesis published in 
                        <emph render="italic">Smith College Studies in Modern Languages</emph> (1922). Amongst the memorabilia is a sign from Lake George that, according to a note on it, was given to McCausland by Alfred Stieglitz, presumably some time during the 1930s.</p>
                    <p>Also found is material relating to the scrip McCausland received as payment for work at 
                        <emph render="italic">The Springfield Republican</emph> in 1933; a car trip McCausland made with Berenice Abbott in 1935; and a testimonial dinner for McCausland "in recognition of her work in the field of art criticism and of her efforts on behalf of all artists" which was held on May 28, 1945 at the Hotel Breevort in New York.</p>

                    <p>Series consists primarily of McCausland's professional and, to a lesser extent, personal correspondence, which includes general, artist, and some family correspondence. Correspondence typically consists of letters to and copies of letters from McCausland, along with enclosures (such as clippings and other printed material; contracts, agreements, and other business and financial papers; and proposals and manuscripts) and related material (such as notes, illustrations, and writings). Correspondents include artists, art organizations, museums, curators, editors, publishers, scholars, research institutions, her agent (Mary Squire Abbot), friends, and her mother, Belle Noble McCausland. Correspondence largely documents McCausland's various professional activities as an art critic, art historian, and freelance writer, and her relationships with various figures of the art and publishing worlds before, during, and immediately after the Second World War.</p>
                    <p>General correspondence relates to articles and reviews that McCausland wrote for the Springfield Republican; to freelance articles she wrote over the years for various publications, including ones for 
                        <emph render="italic">Parnassus</emph>, 
                        <emph render="italic">The New Republic</emph>, and

                        <emph render="italic">Art and Advertising</emph>; her work as a research consultant on the American Processional exhibition and book, and on other exhibitions; and her involvement in various art and social organization, as well as her participation in various conferences. General correspondence largely documents McCausland's tireless efforts to drum up work, and to fund (through various grants and fellowships) and carry out her many research and writing projects.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence from particular artists, including Arthur Dove, Louis Eilshemius, Marsden Hartley, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Alfred Stieglitz, was maintained by McCausland in files separate from general correspondence. Artist correspondence documents her relationships with these artists - particularly well-documented are her relationships with Dove and Stieglitz - and the artists' reactions to her reviews of their shows. Files of artist correspondence also include some of McCausland's own notes on her feelings about or relationship with particular artists.</p>
                    <p>Family correspondence consists almost entirely of letters and copies of letters from McCausland to her mother, Belle Noble McCausland. These seem to have originated from the scrapbook kept by McCausland's mother which can be found amongst personal papers.</p>

                    <p>General correspondence is arranged in rough chronological order. Within individual yearly files, McCausland often grouped together letters to and from a particular correspondent; this existing organization has for the most part been maintained. Selected artist correspondence and family correspondence are arranged in files at the end of the series. Correspondence can also be found amongst research and writing files.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>This series comprises some of McCausland's general writings apart from those related to specific research projects, including speeches and lectures, poems, and scattered essays and articles. Speeches and lectures include ones on art criticism and patronage, on the artist Marsden Hartley, and on various art topics given at various universities, conferences, meetings, and other events from 1940 to the mid-1950s. Poems most likely date from the 1930s and include manuscripts of individual poems and titled collections, which McCausland may have published on her own private press. Also found are some unpublished manuscripts, including two "dummy" articles written for a proposed magazine at the request of Bob Rogers and some material relating to a proposed book on silk screen, and a manuscript of an article on scientific photography by Willard D. Morgan, which may have been ghostwritten by McCausland.</p>

                    <p>Series consists of files relating to McCausland's research for the exhibition, "A. H. Maurer: 1868-1932" (Walker Art Center, September 11-October 16, 1949 and Whitney Museum of American Art, November 6-December 11, 1949), which she helped organize and for which she did the catalog, and her book, 
                        <emph render="italic">A. H. Maurer</emph>, which was published for the Walker Art Center by A. A. Wyn in 1951. Files consist of correspondence, drafts and manuscripts of the exhibition catalog and book, and extensive research material, including photographs of Maurer's paintings (organized according either to the year they were executed and to their subject matter), photographs of the artist, notes on his life and work (typically organized according to time period or period of execution), notes on his correspondence, and other material. Also found is some Maurer art work.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence consists of incoming and copies of outgoing letters. Correspondents include Walker Art Center staff, friends and family of Maurer contacted as part of McCausland's research (his sister Eugenia Maurer Fuerstenberg and his nephew Alfred S. Maurer, and former friends Fra Dana, Pierre Daura, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Grace Phillips, among others), publishers, museums, research institutions, and other instrumental figures, such as Hudson Walker and Lloyd Goodrich. The contents of many correspondence files are arranged in reverse chronological order.</p>
                    <p>The largest portion of the Maurer files are devoted to photographs of his paintings (not scanned). These seem to have been collected as part of an effort to record "about a thousand Maurers," which were photographed in small batches of four or six at a time. These photographs were then used, in conjunction with available documentation, to date Maurer's works based on style, and have not been scanned. Other photographs used in the research seem to have been copied from Maurer's friends and family members.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>This series consists of files relating to McCausland's work as a research consultant on the exhibition, "American Processional, 1492-1900" at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., July 8-December 17, 1950, and as editor of the accompanying book. The exhibit was described as "a large exhibition of American life and history in pictures" and was planned in cooperation with the National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission "to commemorate the establishment of the permanent seat of the Federal Government in Washington in 1850." The book included two hundred illustrations of work from the exhibition with text comprised of "quotations from contemporaries of the events shown" and writing by McCausland. (These descriptions are drawn from a letter from McCausland to Norman Corwin dated June 20, 1950.)</p>
                    <p>Files include research notes organized according to time period of the work of art, manuscripts and proofs of the book, catalog material, notes on sources and permissions, correspondence, and other research and publicity material.</p>
                    <p>A large amount of correspondence relating to the American Processional can also be found in the General Correspondence series. A watercolor by Frank Buffmire documenting McCausland's contributions to the American Processional in a humorous fashion can be found amongst art work.</p>

                    <p>Series consists of extensive files relating to a major research project on the artist Marsden Hartley begun by the American Art Research Council around 1944 and turned over to McCausland by Hudson Walker in the early 1950s. The project involved a planned critical biography, envisaged as a companion volume to McCausland's biography of Maurer, and a projected catalogue raisonne of Hartley's paintings, neither of which was ever completed. Related projects included an introductory monograph on Hartley written by McCausland, focusing on the Hudson D. Walker collection of more than 150 Hartleys on long-term loan to the University of Minnesota, which was published in 1952; and a traveling exibition, organized by the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and American Federation of Arts, which took place from 1960 to 1962 and for which McCausland did the catalog.</p>
                    <p>Some material may have been created and collected by the American Art Research Council, particularly portions of the catalogue raisonne files and other research files. McCausland seems to have incorporated this material into her own files and/or used and reorganized it as necessary in conjunction with creating and collecting material in her own files.</p>

                    <p>The bulk of this series has been scanned, including photographs of works of art, except when obviously duplicate. Many of the photographs of works of art in this series include annotations and research notes on the reverse or relate so closely to the research notes that the decision was made to scan them. Identyfing the duplicate photographs was difficult, thus many have been scanned. The card files of McCausland's indexes have not been scanned, nor were auction catalogs. In many cases, only the covers and title pages of publications were scanned.</p>

                        <p>Subseries consists of files relating to McCausland's work researching and writing a planned critical biography of the artist Marsden Hartley. McCausland began work on the biography sometime after her monograph on Hartley was published in 1952. She worked on the Hartley biography for several years off and on up until her death in 1965, though it was never completed. Files are primarily comprised of notes on Hartley's life and work (organized according to time period), as well as some research material, including typescripts and some originals of Hartley's letters, exhibition catalogs and other printed material, and scattered papers belonging to Hudson Walker and relating to Hartley. Also found are an outline and a manuscript of Chapters 1-3 of the planned biography, and some notes and research material on exhibitions, memorabilia, and portaits.</p>
                        <p>Most of the material is undated, yet it can be reasonably assumed that it was collected and created during the time period from 1953 to 1964, roughly when McCausland was working on the biography.</p>

                        <p>Subseries consists of extensive files relating to the planned published catalogue raisonne of Hartley paintings. Files were probably started circa 1944 by the American Art Research Council and were eventually taken over, used, and added to by McCausland up until the time before her death. Files consist of photographs of and research forms for individual Hartley paintings, as well as some scattered notes and printed material.</p>

                        <p>Subseries consists of correspondence and other files concerning more technical or business-related aspects of McCausland's research, including requests for information, business arrangements with University of Minnesota, permissions, etc. Correspondence also concerns research on Hartley's time in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and aspects of his life and work (including his relationship and correspondence with Rebecca S. James); the Hartley exhibition organized by the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam and American Federation of Arts (1960-1962); the Life Magazine article on Hartley, as well as several articles by McCausland (including a reprint of a speech on Hartley published in Art in America and a piece entitled, "A Field Trip in Hartley Country," for which she sought a publisher); and McCausland's consulting on Hartley forgeries. Files also include original letters from Hartley to Richard Tweedy, 1900-1901 (which were given to the American Art Research Council at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1945, and subsequently turned over to Elizabeth McCausland), Hudson Walker, 1937-1943, and Johann Langaard, 1939; typescripts of Hartley’s letters to Mathilde Rice, Hudson Walker, and Ione Walker; and typescript excerpts of Hartley's letters to unidentified recipients.</p>

                        <p>Files found here substantively relate to McCausland's research on Hartley. Included are files on a Hartley bibliography that include writings by others about Hartley and copies of Hartley's correspondence from other research repositories. There are also files on various research topics, such as chronology and exhibitions, Hartley correspondence, dating and style of Hartley works, and iconography of Hartley's "Military Series"; research forms for the Hartley paintings in the Hudson Walker Collection on long-term loan to the University of Minnesota; and various "working" files of unsorted material meant to be entered on forms, filed, or returned. Files also include photographs of works of art (many not scanned); writings, including a piece on Georgia O'Keeffe and possibly other scattered writings by Hartley and a piece "Hartley Fragments" by McCausland; and some notes on the manuscript of the biography.</p>

                    <p>Series consists of files of clippings (including some clippings of McCausland's articles for The Springfield Republican), scattered notes and correspondence, photographs, and other printed material organized according to subject. Some files may have been collected as reference files. Others may relate to further research activities and interests of McCausland or possibly even to some unidentified research projects. Some files (mostly clippings of McCausland's articles on different artists and art topices) were loosely grouped together under the heading "Art and Social History" although it is unclear why or what this means.</p>

                    <p>Series consists of files relating to McCausland's work organizing various exhibitions, including "The World of Tomorrow" exhibition at The Berkshire Museum in the summer of 1939, the first comprehensive group exhibition of silk screen color prints at the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts in March 1940, another (perhaps related) group exhibition of silk screen color prints at the New York State Museum in the summer of 1940, and an exhibition of contemporary photography at the A.C.A. Gallery in August 1944. Files include correspondence, lists of works, text for wall labels and catalogs, and photographs. Files document McCausland's activities of selecting works, planning, and making arrangements for the exhibitions, and her interactions with others involved, such as Laura Bragg at The Berkshire Museum, Charles Adams at the New York State Museum, Audrey MacMahon at the Works Progress Administration, Edward Landon, and various artists.</p>

                    <p>Series consists primarily of files relating to a course on American art history taught by McCausland at Barnard College during the spring and fall semesters of 1956. Files include course material, lectures, notes, correspondence, and printed material. Also found are scattered files relating to a course on culture morphology or the morphology of design at the Laboratory School of Industrial Design in 1939; a course, or series of lectures, on American art and American life given at Cooper Union in 1952; her teaching stint at Sarah Lawrence College in the early 1940s; and a planned course on American art at the University of Southern California during the summer session of 1965, which McCausland ultimately had to back out of due to illness.</p>

                    <p>Series consists of files relating to McCausland's involvement in various artist committees and associations, and art organizations. Included are files stemming from her work on the Promotion Committee of the New York City Council for Art Week, which was involved in planning National Art Week 1940 and sought to promote the purchase of art by the general public; and on the Advisory Committee on Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, on which she served with Ansel Adams and Paul Strand, among others. Also found are files stemming from her participation in the Artists League of America, organizing the Critics Group and planning a national conference on artists in the war; in the Artists Societies for National Defense, which was a collective of art organizations dedicated to developing a program for the use of art in national defense; and on the Writers War Board of the Author's League, which held a meeting on "The American Arts Work for the War" in May 1942. There are also some general files on art organizations and on McCausland's community interests and political activities. Files typically include minutes, reports, correspondence, notes, writings, and printed material.</p>

                    <p>Series consists of photographs of artists and works of art, photographs as art, and prints from photography exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art collected by McCausland in the course of her wide-ranging research and writing activities. Of particular note amongst the photographs as art are those taken by Berenice Abbott from 1935 to 1938 as part of a WPA project to document the city and published as a book, 
                        <emph render="italic">Changing New York</emph> (1939), with commentary by McCausland. Of particular note amongst the photographs of artist are ones of Isamu Noguchi working on his "News" plaque for the Associated Press Building at Rockefeller Center circa 1938-1940. Also found are some photographs of McCausland, including one with Gertrude Stein taken in 1934 (the original of which is missing).</p>
                    <p>Included in many of the photograph files are copy prints and negatives made by the Archives.</p>
