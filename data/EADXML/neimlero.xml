            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>LeRoy Neiman has been described as the most popular living painter in America. While strikingly original, his work reflects the varied influences of Toulouse-Lautrec, Dufy, the New York Social Realists, and the Abstract Expressionists. Probably best known as a portrayer of sporting and social events, he virtually invented the modern genre of sports art and remains its most accomplished and acclaimed practitioner.</p>
            <p>Among many other accomplishments, he was the first and only on-camera official artist for ABC-TV at the Olympics in Munich, 1972 and Montreal, 1976, and covered several other winter and summer Olympiads as an official artist. He was the first artist to create live, on-camera computer art while covering the 1978 Super Bowl in New Orleans for CBS-TV. In 1997 he was selected as the first official artist of the Kentucky Derby. But Neiman's interests range far and wide. As a painter, printmaker, and author, his subjects have included Parisian cafés, African safaris, famous bars, five-star restaurants, urban street scenes, the opera, political figures, jazz musicians, entertainers, stage and screen stars, gambling casinos, portraits, international stock exchanges, and much more.</p>
            <p>For the past quarter-century, Neiman has created limited-edition serigraphs (silk-screen prints). Published and distributed exclusively by Knoedler Publishing, they are sold in selected galleries throughout the United States. By one estimate, the more than 150,000 Neiman prints that have been purchased to date have an estimated market value exceeding $400 million. Neiman is the author of twelve books: 
                <emph render="italic">Horses</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">LeRoy Neiman Posters</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Winners</emph>, which was also published in Japanese,

                <emph render="italic">LeRoy Neiman Sketchbook: Liston vs. Clay 1964/ Ali vs. Liston 1965</emph>, 2004. Knoedler Publishing has published 
                <emph render="italic">The Prints of LeRoy Neiman</emph>, Volumes I-III, a catalogue raisonnes on Neiman's limited edition prints.</p>
            <p>Over the years the artist has donated scores of his artworks to dozens of charitable causes and organizations. Through his work with the Good Tidings Foundation, two LeRoy Neiman Art Centers for Youth have been built in elementary schools in California. In 1995, he gave the School of the Arts at Columbia University in New York City an endowment of $6 million to create the LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies, dedicated to the study of fine art printmaking and the development of new methods of printmaking, and including a scholarship program. A 1998 donation led to the creation of the LeRoy Neiman Center for the Study of American Culture and Society at UCLA.</p>
            <p>Neiman's work is represented in the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum, the Minneapolis Museum of Art, the Hermitage of St. Petersburg and numerous other museums and public and private collections worldwide. A past member of the New York City Advisory Commission for Cultural Affairs, Neiman has received five honorary degrees and, among other honors, an Award of Merit from the American Athletic Union, a Gold Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Muscular Dystrophy Association, in addition to being named Boxing Artist of 1966 by Lonsdale, London.</p>

            <p>
                <list>
                    <item>Hammer Galleries, New York, had its first show of LeRoy Neiman works in 1963 and has represented him ever since.</item>
                    <item>Armand Hammer was the proprietor of Hammer Galleries, which he founded in 1929 upon returning from the Soviet Union with a load of Czarist art. His brother Victor was in charge of running the gallery.</item>
                    <item>Armand became the chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation in 1957.</item>
                    <item>Maury Leibowitz became a partner with the Hammers at the gallery around the same time they began representing Mr. Neiman.</item>
                    <item>Hammer and O.P.C. bought the respected M.K. Knoedler &amp; Co. gallery in New York in 1971 with Leibowitz as a partner. Knoedler merged with Modarco, a Swiss investment firm, during the 1970s after its purchase by O.P.C.</item>
                    <item>Knoedler-Modarco now has three divisions: M. Knoedler &amp; Co. (founded in 1846), Knoedler Publishing (created for the sole business of publishing and distributing the prints and posters of LeRoy Neiman), and Hammer Galleries.</item>
                    <item>Felicie Schumsky was LeRoy Neiman's publisher and distributor before Knoedler. Felicie, Inc. is named alone in advertising until 1973, when ads appear naming FKH Editions as publisher (presumably 'Felicie Knoedler Hammer') and Hammer Galleries as gallery/distributor. This continues until 1975, when ads begin naming Knoedler as publisher and Hammer as gallery.</item>
                    <item>Hammer Graphics Gallery, a part of Hammer Galleries, was started in 1979 for the sole purpose of distributing and exhibiting the graphic work of LeRoy Neiman.</item>
                    <item>Victor Hammer died in July 1985, and Armand Hammer died in 1990 at age 92 (less than a year after losing his wife Frances), leaving his son Michael Hammer as the chairman and president of The Armand Hammer Foundation. Maury Leibowitz died in 1992.</item>
