            <p>The papers of New York video artist and painter Robert Wiegand measure 10.3 linear feet and date from 1953 to 1994. Found within the collection are biographical materials, correspondence, art project and exhibition files, printed materials, video art, photographs, and industrial and miscellaneous video recordings. About one-half of the collection is comprised of video recordings.</p>
            <p>Biographical materials include school yearbooks, video and paper documentation from his 1991 wedding, and photograph and video documentation of his funeral and memorial service in 1994. Also found are resumes and Wiegand's SoHo live/work artist permit from 1976.</p>
            <p>Correspondence is comprised primarily of letters written by Wiegand, which were saved onto floppy disks and printed out, and a handful of letters received. Outgoing letters mainly concern Wiegand's video production work for hire and other personal financial matters. Letters received relate primarily to Wiegand's painting sales, and are from James McLeon, Vivian Browne, Susan Larson, Burt Chernow, and Alexandra Rose. Additional correspondence can be found in the project files.</p>
            <p>Project files include documentation of the 1968 inagural "10 Downtown" exhibition, the 
                <title render="italic">City Walls</title> mural project, a multimedia art work created through the Experiments in Art and Technology (EAT) project called 
                <title render="italic">Changes</title>, the products of the 1978 trip to India, including the video work 
                <title render="italic">Snapshots of an Indian Day</title>, the "Madama Butterfly" video production produced by Wiegand, and the artist panel series 
                <title render="italic">ArtistsTalkonArt</title>. The files contain a wide variety of documentation, such as correspondence, event flyers and press materials, photographs, slides, and videos.</p>
            <p>Printed materials include exhibition and event announcements and catalogs, clippings and reviews, magazine publications, and published books that contain Wiegand's work. There is also one scrapbook compiled by Wiegand for his 5th One Man Show of Paintings at the Phoenix Gallery in New York City.</p>
            <p>Video artworks created by Wiegand, often made in collaboration with his wife Ingrid, include 
                <title render="italic">Georges</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Julie</title>,

                <title render="italic">How to tell an artist with Dr. Sheldon Cholst</title>. Photographs include a combination of personal and professional photographs, although most of the materials are slides of artworks and events. Of note are slides from the "Bicentennial Banners" exhibition that Wiegand was invited to participate in and that was on display at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum in 1976.</p>
            <p>The last series contains over 4 linear feet of all other video recordings and includes industry productions, independent projects, performance documentation, work samples, and works by others.

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Robert Nelson Wiegand (1934-1994) was a painter and video artist who worked and lived in New York City. Robert Wiegand's interest in art extended well beyond the point of creation, and throughout his life he worked not only as painter, but also as a teacher, advocate, and documentarian of the arts in New York City.</p>
            <p>Born in Long Island in 1934, Wiegand attended the State University of New York, College of Buffalo and received a degree in arts education. He returned to New York City and became active in the artist community in SoHo. He was one of the co-founders of the SoHo Artists Association, an artists' organization formed to advocate for legalizing artist loft live/work spaces in lower Manhattan in the 1960s.</p>
            <p>Wiegand married his first wife Ingrid in 1964, and they collaborated on many creative endeavors. They adopted two children from India, Indira and Pratap (also known as Peter), and separated in 1990. He married painter Lynn Braswell in 1991.</p>
            <p>As a painter, Wiegand's work was highly geometric and influenced by the Abstract Expressionist movement. He exhibited paintings in one-man shows in New York City at the Phoenix Gallery and at the Levitan Gallery. In 1968, Wiegand participated in the first "10 Downtown" exhibition, where artists exhibited in their own studios in a move to overcome exclusive gallery representation practices. After painting a few exterior house murals, Wiegand co-founded 
                <title render="italic">City Walls</title>, a New York City mural project that was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. Through this project he became responsible for a handful of the murals in lower Manhattan. In 1968, Wiegand collaborated with Lloyed Kreutzer, a Bell Labs physicist specializing in lasers, to create the installation work 
                <title render="italic">Changes</title> as part of Experiments In Art and Technology's (EAT) 1968 competition bringing together artists and engineers. It was then shown at Wiegand's studio in 1969. Wiegand was also one of the co-founders of 
                <title render="italic">ArtistsTalkOnArt</title>, an artist run non-profit organization that continues to program weekly artist panel discussions in Soho, NY. It was co-founded in 1974 by Wiegand, Lori Antonacci, Bruce Barton, and Douglas Sheer.</p>
            <p>Wiegand became interested in video in the 1960s after using it as a documentary tool in the successful effort to legalize loft living in lower Manhattan. He then began creating video artworks, many of which were collaborations with his wife Ingrid. They received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1977 to produce a documentary on middle class life in India called 
                <title render="italic">Snapshots of an Indian Day</title>. It was shown at The Kitchen and Anthology Film Archives before being acquired by the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, NY. In 1980, with the help of his students from the Global Village Intensive Video Workshop, Wiegand directed, shot, and edited the Brooklyn Opera Society's production 
                <title render="italic">Madama Butterfly</title> at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and Tea House, and the production aired on WNYC-TV 13 as part of its 
                <title render="italic">Other Voices: New York</title> series.</p>
            <p>From 1971 to 1980, Wiegand ran his own commercial video company, Wiegand Video, where he produced corporate and industry training films. From 1980 to 1987, he worked as a project manager and producer for Square Twelve Productions, continuing to produce commercial work. His clients included the American Society for Mechanical Engineers and International Business Machines.</p>
            <p>Wiegand also taught art and video production at the Staten Island Academy from 1961-1971, studio and television production at the New School for Social Research from 1980 to 1984, and field production at the Lehman College City University of NY. He also taught in the New York City C.E.T.A. program in media training and was a visiting media production instructor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of his life, Wiegand changed careers and became a social worker. Robert Wiegand died in New York City in 1994, just after his 60th birthday.</p>

                    <p>Correspondence is comprised primarily of letters written by Wiegand, and a handful of letters received. Outgoing letters are found in the form of floppy disks and paper records assumed to correspond to the contents of floppy disks.</p>
                    <p>Outgoing letters primarily concern job hunting and other personal financial matters, but other types of documents are scattered throughout the series such as television series pitches, lecture notes on artist talks, scripts for video works, draft resumes and bios, and cover letters for job applications. One folder contains correspondence written by Wiegand to his son's teachers.</p>
                    <p>Letters received include sixteen original letters containing feedback and inquiries about artworks. Letters are from James McLeon, Vivian Browne, Susan Larson, Burt Chernow, and Alexandra Rose, among others. Additional correspondence can be found in the project files. Personal cards consist of a handful of commercially produced greeting cards received by Wiegand. One postcard is from 1962, while the remaining are greeting cards that date to the early 1990s.</p>

                    <p>This series contains photographs and slides of Robert Wiegand and his work. The photographs include portraits, family photos, artworks, and images of Wiegand's studio at the time of his death in 1994. The slides are mainly of artworks and were accessioned in binders labeled as Master Slides and Duplicate Slides, which were disassembled.

                    <p>This series contains video recordings that are neither Wiegand's artworks or personal recordings, but other types of recordings he produced, as well as a few tapes made both others found with his papers. Categories of recordings in the series are industry productions, independent projects, performance documentation, work samples, and works by others.</p>
                    <p>Industry productions are mainly educational and training videos made for companies such as IBM, Dynalloy Company, DJR Associates, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Also found is a tape made for the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program called 
                        <title render="italic">The Sentence II</title>. Wiegand's process involved using low quality video equipment to storyboard and write scripts in the pre-production phase, and these tapes are found among the finished projects, along with occasional paper documentation.</p>
                    <p>Independent projects include unedited footage, excerpts, and finished programs that Wiegand created for small organizations and individuals. Notable projects include
                        <title render="italic">Bob Towbin's B-Day Special</title>, a home-movie-artwork hybrid video created by Ingrid and Robert for Bob Towbin's 35th birthday, 
                        <title render="italic">The Night Before The Night Before Christmas</title>, a project produced by Wiegand that aired on DCTV, an 
                        <title render="italic">Arts Mag</title> episode produced by Ingrid Wiegand, and clips of Angelique Martin's talk show, edited by Robert Wiegand. Wiegand also shot, edited and produced Pamela Stockwell's reenactment of the Tompkins Square Riot. All the unedited footage of the reenactment, in addition to the finished edited piece, are in this series. The printed materials series contains paper documentation related to a few of these videos.</p>
                    <p>Performance documentation contains video of performing artists Trisha Brown, Leonard Horowitz, Carolee Schneeman, and Laura Foreman, among others, and four compilation tapes of performances Wiegand shot. Trisha Brown's 
                        <title render="italic">Line-Up</title> performance also includes an interview with her. Eight hours of raw footage of performances at the East Village performance club, ABC No Rio, are also found.</p>
                    <p>Work samples include compilation clips of Wiegand's works. They were used for teaching and soliciting production work. The first two videos are components of a single work, video and narration, yet neither of them are an edit master. Works by others include two tapes that are tools Wiegand may have used in the creation of his videos, a calibration tape and a sales tape for a video title making tool. 
                        <title render="italic">Eyes on the Prize</title> is an off-air taping of the well-known documentary.</p>
