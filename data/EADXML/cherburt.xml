            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Burt Chernow was an art historian, writer, educator, collector, and dealer who founded the Housatonic Museum of Art in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and who, upon his retirement from Housatonic Community College, became the authorized biographer of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, which he researched through close contact with the Christos from 1984 until his death in 1997. Although he had not completed the biography when he died, his wife Ann Chernow saw the manuscript through to publication, and the biography, 
                <title render="italic">Christo and Jeanne-Claude: A Biography</title>, was first published in Germany in 2000, and then in the United States in 2002.</p>
            <p>Born in New York City in 1933, Chernow earned a master's degree in art education at New York University in 1960, and began his career as an art teacher in the Westport, Connecticut public schools, later joining the faculty of the Art Department at the Housatonic Community College, where he eventually became the department's director. He also taught at the Museum of Modern Art, organizing the Children's Art Carnival in Harlem through the museum, and at Silvermine School of the Arts, the A.B.C.D. Arts Center in Bridgeport, Conn., and the Stamford Museum. While on faculty at Housatonic Community College, he began collecting original artworks, mainly through donations directly from the artists, for what eventually became the Housatonic Museum of Art. Over the course of nearly 30 years he amassed over 4000 works for the collection, the largest of its kind for a community college, and remained the museum's Emeritus Director until his death. He remained active in civic arts organizations in Westport as well, where he was a founding member of the Westport Arts Center, served on the Westport Arts Advisory Council, and helped to establish the annual Westport Arts Awards.</p>
            <p>Upon his retirement from the Housatonic faculty in 1984, Chernow approached Christo and Jeanne-Claude about becoming their authorized biographer. He had participated in their project 
                <title render="italic">Surrounded Islands</title> in Miami in 1983, and had played a role in exhibitions and artist talks by Christo at the Aldrich Museum (1981) and the Wadsworth Atheneum (1978) as well. He and his wife Ann Chernow attended and helped to document the
                <title render="italic"> Wrapped Pont Neuf</title> (1985) in Paris, and then visited Christo's family in Bulgaria in 1986. It was after their Bulgarian trip that Christo and Jeanne-Claude agreed to authorize him to write their biography, and Chernow's research began in earnest. He conducted hundreds of interviews with them, their family, and associates, participated in the major large-scale projects that took place between 1985 and 1995, and completed a draft of the biography up to the year 1982 before he died suddenly in 1997. After his death, his wife Ann Chernow saw the biography through to publication. It was published with an epilogue by Wolfgang Volz, the Christos' official photographer, bringing the Christos' story up to date from where Chernow had left off, first in Germany, and later in the United States and Italy.</p>
            <p>Chernow wrote many books, catalogs, and articles about other artists as well, including Milton Avery, Francisco Zuniga, Gabor Peterdi, Will Barnet, Jean Woodham, and Lester Johnson, among others, and published and lectured widely on the subjects of art education and public art.</p>

            <p>The papers of Burt Chernow measure 21.8 linear feet and consist mainly of research materials gathered and produced in the course of writing 
                <title render="italic">Christo and Jeanne-Claude: A Biography</title> over an extensive period of close contact with the subjects, from the early 1980s until Chernow's death in 1997. Research materials for the biography include photocopies of personal documents of the Christos, hundreds of recorded interviews with Christo, Jeanne-Claude, their family members, and their associates, transcripts of interviews and research on interview subjects, other collected research material compiled chronologically, drafts of the biography written by Chernow, drafts of the biography and its epilogue produced after Chernow's death, and business records related to the book's production, which include significant correspondence with the Christos. Also found are the published German and U.S. editions of the biography, printed materials and photographs related to the book's subject matter, and fabric samples from five of the Christos' projects undertaken during Chernow's association with them.</p>
            <p>Chernow's career as an art critic, writer, educator, and arts advocate, primarily in Southern Connecticut, is documented in Chernow's other writings, organizational records, printed materials, and photographs. Other writings include drafts of articles, lectures, exhibition reviews, and catalog essays, some of which include research material gathered on the subjects. Artists written about by Chernow include Arman, Milton Avery, Barkley Hendricks, Francisco Zuñiga, Lester Johnson, Gabor Peterdi, and Jean Woodham, among many others, and including many Connecticut artists. A recorded interview with Arman, as well as transcripts of multiple interviews with Zuñiga, are filed with these writings. Also found are many writings and lectures related to the value of visual art in public life and in elementary and higher education. Numerous lectures by Chernow about several of the Christos' large-scale projects are also found, one of which, on the 
                <title render="italic">Wrapped Reichstag</title>, is recorded on video.</p>
            <p>Organizational records document Chernow's involvement in various art education organizations, his years of teaching at Housatonic Community College, his development of the Housatonic Museum of Art collection, and his work with several local arts organizations in Westport, Conn., including the Westport Arts Advisory Council, the Westport Arts Center, the Westport Schools Permanent Art Collection Committee, and the Westport Weston Arts Council. Types of documents found include correspondence, clippings, photographs, flyers, and notes.</p>
            <p>Printed material includes many of the books written by Chernow, and monographs and magazines which included essays on specific artists by Chernow. A file of clippings about Chernow spanning his career is also found. Photographs include prints, negatives, and contact sheets, and consist mainly of photographs of artists, many of which were taken by Chernow, and many of which are signed by the artists with a personal note to the Chernows. A handful of personal photographs of the Chernows are also found.</p>

                    <p>This series contains materials gathered and produced by Burt and Ann Chernow in the course of writing and publishing
                        <title render="italic">Christo and Jeanne-Claude: A Biography</title>. Materials include photocopied personal documents of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, recorded interviews with Christo and Jeanne-Claude and their associates created by Chernow, recorded interviews and lectures by Christo produced by others, transcripts of those recordings produced by Chernow, clippings, photographs, and letters related to interview subjects, and files of research material arranged chronologically by Chernow as part of his writing process. Among the many significant interview subjects are Arman, Mary Bauermeister, Leo Castelli, Lynn Hershman, Ray Johnson, Allan Kaprow, Ivan Karp, Albert and David Maysles, Claes Oldenburg, Pierre Restany, Niki de Saint Phalle, Peter Selz, Harry Shunk, Holly Solomon, Saul Steinberg, and Sam Weiner.</p>
                    <p>Notes and writings include drafts of the biography written by Burt Chernow and drafts edited posthumously in a process overseen by Ann Chernow. Business records contain correspondence regarding the production and publication of the biography, including significant correspondence between the Chernows and the Christos. Photographs include personal photographs of the Christos and photographs of their projects, installations, and early exhibitions. Fabric samples are from the major projects spanning the years Chernow worked closely with the Christos, from 1983 to 1995. See series descriptions below for further details.</p>
                    <p>Because Chernow died before the biography could be completed, much of his research for the period between 1982 and 1997 is not included in the biography, but is rather summarized in an epilogue by the photographer Wolfgang Volz. When he died unexpectedly in 1997, Chernow had only completed work on chapters pertaining to Christo and Jeanne-Claude's lives before he knew them, up to 1982. Documentation of projects executed during Chernow's period of research,

He did, however, write a number of lectures on these subjects, and drafts of these lectures are found in series 2, Other Writings.</p>

Note that the dates in parentheses are the dates of the original documents, and that 1992, the date of the photocopies, is based on query letter from Burt Chernow to Jeanne Claude requesting the copies dated 1992. Additional photographs of Jeanne-Claude's first wedding are found in series 1.8, Photographs.</p>

                        <p>Series consists primarily of documents copied from Christo and Jeanne-Claude's personal papers by Burt Chernow, including Christo and Jeanne-Claude's passports, an address book, appointment books (referred to throughout the papers as "agendas") dating from 1961-1995 (not inclusive, with two books for each of the years 1986-1990), Commission offers, family letters, legal documents, and photographs. Chernow used these materials heavily in his writing process, generating lists of trips and contacts made from the appointment books, which were then used as a basis for his research on specific periods of the artists' lives. Except for the 1968 calendar noted as original, all biographical materials are photocopies made by Burt Chernow from the personal records of Christo and Jeanne-Claude.</p>
                        <p>In his papers, Chernow identified certain appointment books as belonging to either Jeanne-Claude or Christo, and he labelled certain appointment books "travel agendas." Chernow's labeling of the appointment books has been retained in the inventory of his photocopies, but these labels are in some ways misleading. Some of the appointment books identified as belonging to one or the other actually have notations in more than one hand and must have been shared to some extent, and the appointment books Chernow called "travel appointment books" do not differ substantially from other appointment books not identified as travel-related.</p>
                        <p>Letters to Jeanne-Claude in this series include letters from her mother, father, and sister Joyce and are all in French. Legal documents document Jeanne-Claude's divorce from her first husband Philippe Planchon, and are filed with photographs of Jeanne-Claude and Planchot. These documents are also in French, and have been translated by Ann Chernow. One sound cassette with a recording of her translating the documents is also found. Nine letters from Christo written between 1957 and 1961, mostly written to his brother in Bulgarian and French, are found in the form of recorded translations to English by Maria Radicheva, made at the request of Burt Chernow. Letters are mostly to his brother, Anani Javachev. One letter is to his brother and mother, and another is found to his brother and sister-in-law, Maria. Note that paper copies of the original letters are not found in the collection, so the recorded translations are the only extant record of the letters. Commission offers include an extensive file of letters soliciting wrappings for various commercial or promotional purposes, along with Jeanne-Claude's responses to them, all rejected.</p>

                        <p>Sound recordings are mainly comprised of interviews of the Christos, their family, and their associates conducted by Burt Chernow between 1984 and 1996, in the course of his research for 
                            <title render="italic">Christo and Jeanne-Claude: A Biography</title>. Chernow wrote the biography chronologically, collecting research for each period of the Christos' lives in sequence, so the early interviews deal mainly with their early years, and later interviews with more recent years. In some cases, the subject content of the interview -- often a place or project name -- is indicated on the tape label, in which case it is noted in the container list. Interviews with associates include other artists, curators, people who worked on the Christos large-scale projects, critics, and others who knew them personally. Among the many significant interview subjects are Arman, Mary Bauermeister, Leo Castelli, Lynn Hershman, Ray Johnson, Allan Kaprow, Ivan Karp, Albert and David Maysles, Claes Oldenburg, Pierre Restany, Niki de Saint Phalle, Peter Selz, Harry Shunk, Holly Solomon, Saul Steinberg, and Sam Weiner.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the more formal interviews, a series of impromptu interviews were conducted by Ann and Burt Chernow during the three Christo projects that were executed while Chernow was working on the biography: the 
                            <title render="italic">Wrapped Pont-Neuf</title>, 
                            <title render="italic">Umbrellas</title>, and the 
                            <title render="italic">Wrapped Reichstag</title>. These project-related interviews and recordings were typically made on site with spectators and producers of the projects while they were on view. Also found are lectures, press conferences, broadcast programs, recorded notes, and music, including a 1981 lecture on Christo by Jan Van Der Marck.</p>
                        <p>Interviews of Christo by others, and lectures given by Christo which pre-date the period of Chernow's research, are filed at the end of the series. Some were recorded off the air, and others were recorded by Chernow or other attendees to the appearances. Some appear to have been copied from original recordings, and the sound quality is poor. Two musical recordings associated with Christo projects are also found in the series, including a protest song about "Surrounded Islands," and music composed for the Japanese installation of "Umbrellas."</p>
                        <p>Chernow's research was conducted chronologically, that is, Chernow collected information about each period of their lives and then wrote his first draft of that portion of the biography before moving on to the next period. The interviews reflect this process, with earlier interviews covering earlier periods of the artists' lives, and later interviews covering later periods as each section was researched and written.</p>
                        <p>Most of the interviews have partial transcripts in series 1.3, which were created by Burt Chernow. The transcripts typically contain summarized portions, with only the portions Chernow found most salient to his research transcribed. The recordings in this series, then, are a unique record of the complete interviews that took place. Recorded conversations with Jeanne-Claude regarding corrections to Chernow's drafts of the biography, created in 1995-1997, do not have typically have transcripts. See series 1.3 for more details.</p>

                        <head>Arrangement note</head>
                        <p>Interviews with Christo and Jeanne-Claude are filed chronologically at the beginning of the series, and interviews with others about the Christos follow, filed alphabetically by name. Occasionally interviews from both of these categories are found on the same tape, and cross-references are provided in the inventory. For recordings made during the Pont-Neuf project (Sept 1985), the Umbrellas project (October 1991), or the Reichstag project (June 1995), cassettes are filed by project, with cross-references to subjects of the project-specific interviews found in the alphabetical inventory list. The collected interviews and lectures (1977-1984) are filed chronologically. Although the tape inventory created by Ann Chernow that came with the collection does not seem to follow any logical sequence, inventory numbers written on the tapes are included in the container list to facilitate access to the physical tapes in the collection.</p>
                        <p>Additional sound recordings include spoken translations of Christo letters to family in series 1.1, Biographical Materials, a spoken history of the biography project by Ann Chernow, found in series 1.6, Business Records, and an interview with Arman for an article about the artist from 1993, found in series 2, Other Writings.</p>

                        <p>Transcripts for the Christos are arranged chronologically, followed by transcripts and subject files for other subjects, arranged alphabetically or by project. Most of the transcripts for Christo's lectures, as well as interviews of the Christos conducted by others, are filed at the end of the series, although some are integrated into the unedited Christo transcripts. Note that while most of the interviews with both the Christos are filed with the Christo transcripts, a single interview conducted 8/16/95 with both of them is filed with the Jeanne-Claude transcripts. Additional material related to Arman is found in series 2, Other Writings.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                        <p>Series contains mainly files for the interview subjects found in series 1.2, including the Christos, their associates, containing transcripts and sometimes other materials related to the interview subject, such as correspondence, photographs, clippings, and other printed material. Also found are files for individuals who were not interviewed by Chernow, or whose interviews were not recorded, containing research or other material. Transcripts of Christo's lectures and interviews of Chrsito by others that were collected by Chernow are also found in this series.</p>
                        <p>Transcripts for Burt Chernow's interviews with Christo and Jeanne are represented in two separate files, one containing interviews with Christo or both the Christos, and another for interviews with Jeanne-Claude interviewed alone. Each set of these transcripts has unedited and edited versions. The unedited file contains transcripts of all interviews in chronological order, as well as notes from unrecorded conversations, with continuous pagination for the entire set created by Chernow. The edited file contains photocopies of selected pages from these transcripts, with all but the portion used by Chernow in his writing crossed out. Note that many of the transcripts throughout the series contain notes summarizing portions of the session, so transcripts in this series are not a comprehensive record of the interviews found in series 1.2.</p>
                        <p>A large number of photocopies of photographs and exhibition checklists with prices are found with Christo transcripts from 1992. Transcripts throughout the file also include scattered copies of items related to matters discussed in the interviews.</p>
                        <p>Transcripts and subject files for subjects other than the Christos are in individual folders by the interview subject's name or by project. Files for Arman, Ray Johnson, and Mary Bauermeister are particularly rich with additional research and other material. A file of edited transcripts also exists for this portion of the series. Transcripts of Christo lectures and interviews of Christo by others are filed chronologically at the end of the series. A file of tyepscript notes regarding questions for interviews is also found at the end of the series.</p>
                        <p>Note that not all of the transcripts found in this series have recordings in series 1.2. Transcripts and subject files with no corresponding recorded interview in series 1.2 include Lourdes Castro, Paul Cummings, Sam Hunter, James Juszczyk, Nam June Paik, Dieter Rosenkranz, Satcho Todorov, and John Weber, among others.</p>

                        <p>Chronological files contain mostly photocopies and seem to have been compiled by Chernow to organize information in the process of writing the Christos' biography. Files are named by the year in the life of Christo and Jeanne-Claude that they document, and they typically contain a chronology of events compiled from the Christo's appointment books, partial copies of interview transcripts, excerpts of Chernow's draft typescripts of the biography, and copies of printed material relating to events from that year, both in the lives of Christo and Jeanne-Claude and world events generally. Copies of material pulled from other libraries and repositories is mixed with copies of material found elsewhere within the current collection throughout the series. When materials have been copied from other sources, the sources are often not cited. Certain sources have been copied with portions interspersed throughout this series, such as the PhD dissertation of Carline Bouihlet on Christo, entitled 
                            <title render="italic">Christo : Dialectical Materialism and Artistic Consumerism</title>, a manuscript with annotations in red pen that is not otherwise identified.</p>
                        <p>Among the chronological files are files for specific locations where the Christos lived or exhibited, files for the Christos' major art projects, and a single file for an individual, Peter Selz, found with the 
                            <title render="italic">Running Fence</title> file for 1976. The Peter Selz file is comprised entirely of photocopies made by Chernow from Selz's papers held at the Archives of American Art. Files bearing project names contain press coverage and documentation relating to the projects, such as engineering records, budgets, and travel schedules. These files are found with the date the project was executed. A file for 
                            <title render="italic">Surrounded Islands</title> (1983) contains the most primary documents of the project-related chronological files. Other notable documents in this series include Italian translations of reviews of Christo's 1963 exhibition in Milan and a photocopy of Christo's 1963 issue of the arts journal 
                            <title render="italic">KWY</title>.</p>
                        <p>A complete set of photocopies of this series, made by Ann Chernow for Wolfgang Volz to aid his writing of the biography's epilogue, was discarded during processing.</p>

                        <p>Notes and writings consist mainly of drafts and revisions of Christo and Jeanne-Claude: A Biography, written by Burt Chernow. Also found are later drafts made by editors after Chernow's death in 1997 and in the process of preparing the book for publication, and a proof and galley of Wolfgang Volz's epilogue, both in German.</p>
                        <p>In a recording found in series 1.6, Business Records, Ann Chernow describes Burt Chernow's writing process in detail, providing an explanation for the unusual arrangement of documents in the early drafts. She explains this directly, saying he would type a small section and then re-type it multiple times, as a method of re-writing and editing. The arrangement of early drafts reflects this process, with multiple versions of brief sections of the text filed together with many annotations. These writings are filed in this series under the heading "Revisions." She also explains that he wrote and revised each section completely before beginning another section, and the arrangement of this series reflects that process. She also explains how Chernow created lists of words for each section to enhance his writing, and some of these lists are filed under the heading "Notes" along with writing fragments on Christo.</p>
                        <p>Significant edits made after Burt Chernow's death are documented in the files named Posthumous Drafts. In her recorded notes on the book's history found in series 1.6, Ann Chernow recounts how during this stage of the editing, Jeanne-Claude removed all mention of her mother's Jewish ancestry before the manuscript was sent to the agent's editor, Tim Mennel. Tim Mennel made significant edits, primarily for repetition and length, before the manuscript was submitted to publishers. Correspondence between Tim Mennel to Ann Chernow is found with the edited typescript, and sometimes notes made by Ann Chernow regarding her response to his edits are also found. The first publisher, Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch in Germany, removed most of the material from the early chapters that dealt with other artists in Christo's circle in Paris and New York. Later the United States publisher, St. Martin's Press, added much of that material back in, cutting portions of Wolfgang Volz's epilogue to make room for it. Posthumous drafts document each stage of these changes to Burt Chernow's manuscript, as well as a proof of the German epilogue by Wolfgang Volz and its translation in the English edition's galleys.</p>

                        <p>In general, writings for the biography are filed in the order of the production process, with Burt Chernow's writings broken down by his initial book sections, which were later changed. Chernow's working titles for each section are in quotation marks in the folder listing.</p>
                        <p>See series 1.6, Business Records, for drafts of additional text generated during the publishing process, such as Jeanne-Claude's foreword, jacket text, various translations, and Ann Chernow's dedication. Business records also contain additional correspondence and contracts with the literary agent, editors, and publishers, as well as copies of all the Christos' approvals of portions of Chernow's manuscript. Series 1.7, Printed Materials, contains published versions of the biography. See series 2, Other Writings, for additional writings by Chernow about the Christos including multiple lectures on Christo and Jeanne-Claude's later projects. Note that Chernow's writing in the current series does not contain writings on the later projects due to his death before completion of the biography.</p>

                        <p>Business Records include documentation related to the production of the biography, including correspondence, agreements and contracts, the Christos' approvals of the manuscript, and publicity. A sound recording on one sound cassette made by Ann Chernow recounts her husband's method of research and writing and the history of the book's publication. Also found in this series are price lists for preparatory works by Christo, which Burt Chernow helped to sell in order to fund his research and writing through an agreement with the Christos.</p>

                        <p>Photographs include personal photographs and photographs of artwork and projects. Personal photographs include snapshots of the Christos' New York City studio from 1988, photographs of the Christos from the early 1960s through the 1990s, and early family photographs of both of their families collected by Chernow. Also found are photographs of Ann and Burt Chernow with the Javacheff's during their 1986 Bulgarian research trip, which began their research for the biography. Some of these photographs were used in the biography, and many of the older photographs are found in the collection as copy prints only, although some original prints are also found. Photocopies of some photographs found in the published book but not with Chernow's papers, annotated by Ann Chernow, are also found.</p>
                        <p>Project folders contain a mix of official photographs of completed projects, photographs and postcards of project drawings, personal photographs taken during the project in the form of snapshots, negatives, contact sheets, and prints, and in some cases memorabilia from projects, such as Burt Chernow's access pass to the Wrapped Reichstag and a vintage photo of a Florida Hotel for Surrounded Islands. Several of the projects contain photographs of Christo, Jeanne-Claude, and other project workers on site with the projects. Many of the project photographs were taken by either Shunk-Kender or Wolfgang Volz, the Christos' official photographers.

                    <p>This series contains drafts of writings by Burt Chernow other than his biography of Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Most of his writings are in the form of articles, reviews, and lectures. Some writing projects include significant material in addition to drafts, including a lengthy unpublished article on the artist Arman, which includes drafts, research, and a 1993 interview with the artist on one sound cassette. Other writings with significant additional material include multiple pieces on Jean Woodham along with notes and research, and a lengthy article on Francisco Zuniga with three transcripts of interviews with the artist and research material collected for the article. Material found with drafts for a book on Milton Avery drawings include correspondence with Sally Avery and a draft of her preface to the book, as well as numerous photographs of Avery's artwork. Also common among the articles in the series are reviews of exhibitions held in Connecticut during the 1980s, and essays written for many exhibition catalogs. Art education and public art are also common subjects among Chernow's writings in this series.</p>
                    <p>Additional writings about the Christos found in this series include lectures by Chernow on 
                        <title render="italic">Surrounded Islands</title>, 
                        <title render="italic">Umbrellas</title>, and 
                        <title render="italic">Wrapped Reichstag</title>. These writings are particularly significant because they are projects undertaken while Chernow was following the Christos closely during his research for the biography, and also because they are projects that Chernow had not yet covered in the biography at the time of his death, so the lectures represent his only completed writings on these projects. Found with the 
                        <title render="italic">Wrapped Reichstag</title> text is a video recording of Burt and Ann Chernow delivering this lecture in Westport. Lectures also include multiple talks given on art education and public art earlier in Chernow's career, and a lecture written for a traveling exhibition "12 Soviet Artists", shown in Westport, Conn. in 1976.</p>
                    <p>Poetry by Burt and Ann Chernow, as well as teaching notes, syllibi, and résumés are also found in this series. Writings by others include two lengthy typescripts of lectures on art education by Howard Conant, who was Chernow's teacher, as well as articles by others about Christo, and an interview with Burt Chernow by Brazilian journalist Georgia Lobacheff.</p>

                    <p>Organizational records document Chernow's affiliations with organizations, primarily in Connecticut, for which he worked, or in which he served as an officer or member. Records include correspondence, catalogs, clippings, yearbooks, notes, writings, and photographs. Records are found related to Housotanic Community College (which later became Housatonic Community Technical College) where Chernow taught, the Housatonic Museum of Art, founded by Chernow, multiple projects of the Westport arts advisory council, the Westport Arts Center, the Westport schools permanent art collection committee, and the Westport Weston arts council. The bulk of records are for the Westport arts awards, organized by the Westport arts advisory council, which include correspondence, notes, writings, photographs, event invitations, and financial records. The "One Percent for the Arts Ordinance" file documents Chernow's advocacy for the ordinance in correspondence with town representatives, drafts of the ordinance, and collected documents relating to a similar "Art in Architecture" program from 1977. Records for the Housatonic Community College include yearbooks from three of the years Chernow taught there, with multiple photographs of him marked within them. A photograph of Chernow with Governor Rowland of Connecticut is also found relating to the construction of the Bridgeport facility for the Housatonic College in 1997. A small file is also found for Connecticut Fine Arts, Chernow's art dealership business, containing letters and a database printout of artworks.</p>

                    <p>Photographs by Ann and Burt Chernow are filed first in the series, followed by photos of the Chernows alone and with artists. Photographs by other photographers are filed at the end of the series, with known photographers listed in the folder listing. Because photographs are arranged by photographer, note that there are multiple photographs of some artists filed in different places in this series, such as Mary Bauermeister, Lester Johnson, Paul Jenkins, Gabor Peterdi, and Christo.</p>
                    <p>Additional photographs are found in series 1, 2, and 3. See series descriptions for more details.</p>

                    <p>Series includes many photographs of artists taken by the Chernows, as well as photographs collected but not taken by them, and many of these are signed and dedicated to Ann and Burt Chernow by the artists. Most of the signed photographs were framed when donated, with a note that they had hung in Burt Chernow's office. These photographs were taken out of their frames during processing, but most remain matted.</p>
                    <p>A few photographs of Burt and Ann Chernow are also found, along with photographs of them with artists such as Mary Bauermeister and the Christos. Several of the photographs by the Chernows come with negatives and contact sheets as well. Some of the photographs of artists not credited to the Chernows may in fact have been taken by them, but are not credited, or do not include evidence of their production such as negatives or contact sheets for identification.</p>
                    <p>Also found in this series are photographs of a bust of Chernow by an unidentified artist, and photocollages by Burt Chernow, one of which is labled, "Burt's last work of art."</p>
