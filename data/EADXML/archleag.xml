            <head>Related Material</head>
            <p>Among the holdings of the Archives of American Art are several collections that contain Architectural League of New York records. The American Federation of Arts records, 1895-1993, include a significant amount of League records related to national awards programs and lantern slides from the "New Horizons in America" lecture series.</p>

            <head>Processing Information</head>
            <p>The collection was minimally processed in 2011 by Sarah Haug with funding provided by the Smithsonian Institution's Collections Care and Preservation Fund. Minimal-level processing methodologies have been used to provide access to collections as soon as possible and to eliminate the backlog of unprocessed collections. These collections have been minimally rearranged and usually retain the existing/original folder titles. All materials are rehoused in archival folders and boxes for long-term stability, but often staples and other fasteners are not removed. Documents are usually removed from binders and notebooks for more efficient and stable storage.</p>
            <p>The original filing system of the Architectural League of New York records did not appear to be intact when the processing archivist received the collection. The records were grouped into artificial series and the processing archivist was not able to determine the original filing system. The series arrangement upon accession was mostly retained; however, folders in each series were reorganized for ease of access. Materials within folders have not been rearranged. A normal level of weeding of tax, personnel, and medical records containing personal information was performed.</p>
            <p>Generally, folder headings were transcribed from the original folder labels. Changes to folder headings were made only to clarify folder contents. Information in brackets provides additional context and was added by the archivist based on the folder's contents or the arrangement upon accession.</p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Modeling the organization's name after the Art Students League of New York, the Architectural League of New York was founded in New York City in 1881 by a group of architects who wished to gather and discuss architecture and its relationship to the arts. The group elected D.W. Willard as the first President of the League and they began gathering regularly to discuss and critique each other's sketches and hold competitions. The organization grew quickly and soon the League rented a room in a building on 14th Street between University Place and Fifth Avenue.</p>
            <p>However, by the mid-1880s the founders and more active League members left New York, and membership began to falter. The League was reorganized in 1886, expanding membership beyond professional architects, and incorporated in 1888 with 166 members. In 1889, the League joined with the Art Students League of New York and the Society of American Artists to form the American Fine Arts Society. Thus, in 1892 the three organizations were able to erect a building at 215 West 57th Street where the League remained until 1927 when it moved to 115 East 40th Street.</p>
            <p>The League was run by the Executive Committee and its officers, elected every two years. The beginning of each League season kicked off with an annual dinner in the spring. The League also formed numerous committees to organize activities and manage administrative tasks. Noteworthy committees include the Current Work Committee, House Committee, Finance Committee, Exhibition Committee, Membership Committee, and Scholarships and Special Awards Committee.</p>
            <p>The League's interdisciplinary approach to architecture and the arts was expressed through sponsored forums and discussions with architects and artists. From the League's beginning, the Current Work Committee was established to organize educational forums for members. Recognition of achievement was awarded by an Annual Exhibition from the late 1880s until 1938. In 1950, the League began awarding the annual National Gold Medal Exhibition in various fields such as landscape architecture, engineering, and sculpture. Additionally, the League awarded numerous other scholarships each year. Architects, artists, and arts-related organizations could also rent space in the League building to hold meetings, discussions, and exhibitions.</p>
            <p>The League admitted its first female member in 1934. Notable members of the League included Arnold W. Brunner (President, 1903-1905), Cass Gilbert (President, 1913-1915), Philip Johnson, Robert A.M. Stern, and Russell Sturgis (President, 1889-1893).</p>
            <p>The Architectural League of New York continues to provide educational opportunities and scholarships to students and professionals.</p>
            <p>Background information was gathered from a written history of the League by Cass Gilbert found in this collection and the Architectural League of New York website (http://archleague.org/category/archive/history-archive/).</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The records of the Architectural League of New York measure 115.1 linear feet and date from 1880s-1974 (bulk 1927-1968). The League's mission "to advance the art of architecture" is documented through administrative and business records, committee records and officers' files, exhibition files, records of functions and events, correspondence, publicity files, photographs, lantern slides, and scrapbooks.</p>
            <p>League records prior to 1927 are limited in the collection and are mostly found among Administrative Files. The administrative files include a nearly complete collection of annual reports from 1889-1932 and various meetings minutes from 1889 through the mid-20th century. Also found is a history of the League written by founding member Cass Gilbert, documentation of the changes of the League Constitution and By-Laws during the first half of the 20th century, and other administrative records.</p>
            <p>Over a third of the collection are records from committees, including voluminous records of the Executive Committee, Current Work Committee, House Committee, Finance Committee, Membership Committee, and Scholarships and Special Awards Committee. In addition, there are scattered records for minor committees. Materials include correspondence, meeting minutes, election ballots, financial records, membership records, documents related to awarding scholarships and awards, and other administrative and organizational committee records. Found is the original 1889 agreement between the Architectural League, the Art Students League, and the Society of American Artists to build the American Fine Arts Society building. Throughout the collection, but especially in the Membership Committee subseries, the records provide a glimpse into the struggles the League faced during the Depression through World War II to maintain dues-paying members.</p>
            <p>Officers' Files includes collated records of the League Executive Secretary and Secretary, as well as correspondence of the League President and Treasurer. Materials found here are not comprehensive; similar materials can be found throughout the collection.</p>
            <p>Financial records such as bank statements, correspondence, and ledgers; insurance correspondence and policies; and legal correspondence, are found in the Business Records series. This series does not include records prior to 1926.</p>
            <p>Exhibition files provide detailed documentation of the exhibitions sponsored by, or held at, the League primarily from the 1930s to the early 1970s. Records related to the League Annual Exhibition, the National Gold Medal Exhibitions, and the 1939 World's Fair in New York are found here, as well as exhibition files arranged chronologically by exhibition date and miscellaneous administrative files. Materials include administrative files, applications, correspondence, printed materials, publicity files, and other records related to organizing and managing exhibitions. The files of the Exhibition Committee are also found here.</p>
            <p>Other series which document activities held by, or held at, the League include Functions and Events series and Publicity Files series. Found is correspondence, printed materials, press releases, schedules, and other administrative documents created in organizing events such as dinners, lectures, receptions, balls, and outings. The Records of Other Organizations includes records relating to organizations that had business with the League, often regarding events, meetings, and exhibitions held at the League. Represented here are some records of the American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) and the National Sculpture Society (N.S.S.).</p>
            <p>Correspondence includes miscellaneous correspondence arranged alphabetically by subject or name, and collated correspondence arranged chronologically. Most of the chronological correspondence appears to be Secretaries' files. The materials in the Miscellaneous series seem to have been separated from their original files, or were never filed properly. Therefore, materials and contents are similar to those found in other series, such as correspondence, administrative records, some financial records, and handwritten notes.</p>
            <p>Black and white photographs, a handful of colored photographs, nearly 350 lantern slides, and negatives of exhibitions, buildings, events, and portraits are found in the Photographic Materials series.</p>
            <p>Sixteen scrapbooks include eight scrapbooks of clippings from 1880s-1960s, and seven scrapbooks of notices and printed materials from 1925-1930. Also found is a scrapbook of signatures of event attendees, a clippings scrapbook compiled by Hamilton M. Wright, and a scrapbook of the Archeological Institute of America.</p>

            <p>There are frequently similar and related materials in multiple series, as is indicated in the series' descriptions. The records may originally have been arranged by file owner (committees, secretary, etc.), then by League season (roughly May - April). Most series include a handful of folders in which the original folder title indicates the file owner and League season (i.e. Secretary 1938-1939).</p>

                        <p>The Current Work Committee oversaw the coordination and organization of exhibitions, events, and functions held by the League. Materials include correspondence, meeting minutes from 1943-1966, committee chairmen's files, schedules of events, scattered exhibition files, and other records related to coordinating events. The Current Work Committee was the first League committee formed in the early 1880s; however, committee records prior to 1927 are not found in this collection. Additional Current Work Committee files are found throughout the collection, especially in the Exhibitions series, Functions and Events series, and Publicity Files series, and are often indicted with the folder heading "Current Work [Year Range]."</p>
                        <p>Folders are arranged alphabetically by folder title.</p>

                        <p>The House Committee managed the League building, which included maintenance of the building, management of the common areas such as the restaurant and bar, long-term rental of rooms to other organizations and individual tenants, and managing personnel. Materials include correspondence, inventories, meeting minutes, committee chairmen's files, receipts, personnel records, memoranda, vendors and utilities records, equipment records, and scattered printed materials. Found is the original 1889 agreement between the Architectural League, the Art Students League, and the Society of American Artists to build the American Fine Arts Society building. The bulk of the material is from the 1940s to the mid-1960s.</p>

                        <p>The Secretaries' files include a mix of the elected League Secretary's files and the files of the Executive Secretary (presumably a paid and unelected position). The majority of the Executive Secretaries' files belong to long-time secretary, Lucile A. Pedrick. Materials are primarily correspondence, as well as meeting minutes, notes, memos, and other scattered administrative records. Additional Executive Secretary files are found throughout the collection typically labeled as "Secretary [Year Range]."</p>
                        <p>Folders are arranged alphabetically by folder title.</p>

                        <p>This series provides a chronological history of exhibitions held at the League, both sponsored by the League or held by others. Materials include correspondence, blueprints, administrative records, notices and memos, and other records created in organizing exhibitions. Similar materials can be found in Functions and Events series and the Current Work subseries of the Committee Records series.</p>
                        <p>Folders are arranged chronologically by year and exhibition date; exhibitions in which the exact date is unknown are filed at the beginning of the year in which the exhibition was most likely held.</p>

                        <p>The Architectural League of New York sponsored numerous events for League members in their facilities. Found in this subseries is correspondence, lists, printed materials, receipts, and other materials related to organizing League events. The bulk of the material is from the 1950s-1960s. Generally, folder titles were transcribed from the original folder titles; however, event dates and additional descriptive information may have been added if the processing archivist was able to determine correct information from the folder materials. Similar materials are found in the Current Work subseries and Exhibitions series.</p>
                        <p>Folders are arranged chronologically by year and event date; events in which the exact date is unknown are filed at the beginning of the year in which the event was most likely held.</p>

                        <p>The Architectural League of New York provided rental space in the League building to other organizations or individuals for their events and functions. Found in this subseries is correspondence, lists, printed materials, receipts, and other materials. The bulk of the material is from the 1950s-1960s. Generally, folder titles were transcribed from the original folder titles; however, event dates and additional descriptive information may have been added if the processing archivist was able to determine correct information from the folder materials.</p>
                        <p>Folders are arranged chronologically by year and event date; events in which the exact date is unknown are filed at the beginning of the year in which the event was most likely held.</p>
