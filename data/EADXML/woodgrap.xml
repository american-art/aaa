<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Grant Wood was born near Anamosa, Iowa, in 1891.  In 1901 he moved with his family to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he developed an interest in art, and participated in the Cedar Rapids Art Association.  He attended the Minneapolis School of Design and Handicraft as well as the Art Institute of Chicago.  Wood taught art in Cedar Rapids public schools, and became an active member of the Iowa art community, promoting local artists and public art projects.  In 1932, he and fellow artists founded the Stone City Art Colony.  The colony only lasted two years, and in 1933 he became an art professor at the University of Iowa, where he would continue to teach until his death. Wood also served as spokesman for the concept of Regionalism in art and lectured throughout the United States.  In 1934 he was appointed director of the Federal Public Works of Art Projects for Iowa, and organized artists for public mural projects.  Grant Wood died in 1942, at the age of 51.</p>
