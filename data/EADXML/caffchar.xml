<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Charles Henry Caffin was born in 1854 in England. After graduating from Oxford University, Caffin served as stage manager for outdoor productions with Ben Greet and His Shakespearean Players. During this time, he met actress Caroline Scurfield, whom he later married and had two daughters, Freda and Donna.  Caffin  moved to United States in 1892 where he began to write about art, drama, and dance.  He was an early supporter of the Photo-Secessionists and American modern art.    </p>
<p>Initially, Caffin worked for several years executing murals  from designs prepared by other artists for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the new Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.  Shortly thereafter, however, he began writing for Alfred Stieglitz's <emph render="italic">Camera Notes</emph> and later <emph render="italic">Camera Work</emph>.  He moved to the New York City area and worked as a critic for the <emph render="italic">New York Evening Post, New York Sun</emph>, and later for the <emph render="italic">New York American</emph>. Caffin wrote many books about art, drama, and dance, including <emph render="italic">Photography as Fine Art</emph> (1901),  <emph render="italic">American Masters of Painting</emph> (1902),  <emph render="italic">How to Study Pictures</emph> (1905), and <emph render="italic">Art for Life's Sake</emph> (1913).</p><p>Charles Caffin died in 1918. </p>
