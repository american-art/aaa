            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Holger Cahill was born Sveinn Kristjan Bjarnarson in Iceland in a small valley near the Arctic Circle, on January 13, 1887. His parents, Bjorn Jonson and Vigdis Bjarnadottir, immigrated to the United States from Iceland sometime later in the 1880s. In 1904, his father deserted the family, forcing Sveinn to be separated from his mother and sister to work on a farm in North Dakota. He ran away and wandered from job to job until settling in an orphanage in western Canada, where he attended school and became a voracious reader.</p>
            <p>As a young man, he worked at many different jobs and attended night school. While working on a freighter, he visited Hong Kong, beginning his life-long interest in the Orient. Returning to New York City, he eventually became a newspaper reporter, continued his studies at New York University, and changed his name to Edgar Holger Cahill. In 1919 he married Katherine Gridley of Detroit. Their daughter, Jane Ann, was born in 1922, but the couple divorced in 1927.</p>
            <p>Cahill met John Sloan circa 1920, and they shared a residence. Cahill also wrote publicity (until 1928) for the Society of Independent Artists, through which he made many friends in the arts. From 1922 to 1931, he worked under John Cotton Dana at the Newark Museum, where he received his basic experience in museum work, organizing the first large exhibitions of folk art.</p>
            <p>From 1932 to 1935, he was the director of exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art. In 1935, Cahill was appointed director of the Works Progress/Projects Administration (WPA) Federal Art Project (FAP), until its end in June 1943. In 1938, Cahill organized a countrywide exhibition "American Art Today" for the New York World's Fair. He also married MoMa curator Dorothy Canning Miller in that year.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Profane Earth</emph>, Cahill's first novel, was published in 1927, followed by monographs on Pop Hart and Max Weber, miscellaneous short stories, and a biography of Frederick Townsend Ward, entitled 
                <emph render="italic">A Yankee Adventurer: The Story of Ward and the Taiping Rebellion</emph>. Following the end of the Federal Art Project, Cahill wrote two novels, 
                <emph render="italic">Look South to the Polar Star </emph>(1947) and 
                <emph render="italic">The Shadow of My Hand </emph>(1956).</p>
            <p>Holger Cahill died in Stockbridge, Massachusetts in July 1960.</p>

                    <p>Biographical material includes nine typed career summaries/resumes for Cahill, dated circa 1935-1941. The resumes provide basically the same information with only minor variations in wording, with some handwritten notations and typed inserts to update the descriptions of Cahill's career through the early 1940s.</p>
                    <p>Also found here is a transcript of an interview, "Reminiscences of Holger Cahill," conducted by Joan Pring; a 1961 letter from Cahill's sister; a document entitled "Notes on the life of Holger Cahill" by Cahill's wife, Dorothy C. Miller, which provide details of Cahill's childhood and his work; and a 1988 letter from Dorothy Miller enclosing a copy of Cahill's birth certificate dated 1887. The series also includes a copy of 
                        <emph render="italic">Time</emph> from September 5, 1938, picturing Cahill on the cover and an article about his work with the WPA.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes financial records consisting primarily of receipts and balance sheets for artwork purchased and sold, many of them issued by the American Folk Art Gallery in which Cahill held a partnership with Edith Halpert and Berthe Kroll Goldsmith.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of personal and work-related correspondence (primarily incoming correspondence) between Cahill and various friends and colleagues. While a large portion of the series documents Cahill's position as Director of the FAP, it also extends beyond those years and illuminates other aspects of Cahill's career including his interest in folk and Asian art, and his work as an art critic.</p>
                    <p>There is significant correspondence with the artist Stanton MacDonald Wright between 1936 and 1950, and with the artist Irene Pereira between 1950 and 1953. The series also documents research which Cahill conducted in the late 1940s on the development of the Index of American Design for his introduction to a book on the Index by the National Gallery of Art, published by the Macmillan Company. Correspondence from 1949 provides another angle on the historical details of the FAP through lengthy correspondence documenting Cahill's criticism of William Francis McDonald's book 
                        <emph render="italic">Federal Relief Administration and the Arts</emph> (Ohio State University Press, 1969).</p>
                    <p>There is a large amount of correspondence from July 1960 comprising sympathy letters to Dorothy C. Miller following Cahill's death. Correspondence from 1977 encloses a catalog of an exhibition organized by New York WPA Artists, Inc., at the Parsons School of Design in November 1977. The exhibition,

                        <p>This subseries contains records relating to FAP artists. Correspondence is primarily between Cahill and various artists and includes letters of recommendation written by Cahill. General records include a typescript of an interview with Edith Halpert of Downtown Galleries, a document containing case studies on the "Adjustments of Individuals" during FAP work in Michigan; and printed material. A notebook entitled "Artists Whose Loan Assignments Have Been Completed," records "loans" of artists to various states and cities in order to work on FAP projects.</p>
                        <p>All individual artist files contain a biographical sketch of the artist, unless otherwise noted. Some files also contain photographs of the artist, as indicated.</p>

                        <p>This subseries documents financial allotments for the FAP program on a national and state level. It contains chronologically arranged correspondence and memoranda showing total allocations and containing lists breaking down allotments by state, as well as general correspondence related to allocations.</p>
                        <p>Allocation control cards were produced by the FAP's graphic arts division as a record of prints received in, and distributed by, the FAP's office in Washington D.C. for allocation and exhibition purposes. They give a number indicating the exhibition in which each print was included and a number indicating the total number of prints received (see General Correspondence, 1970, in this subseries). The cards are organized alphabetically by state.</p>
                        <p>Also found here are tables of financial allotment statistics, printed material related to allocations of art work and a notebook entitled
