<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Art historian and art collector Priscilla Cunningham is the daughter of art museum director Charles Cunningham. For over twenty years, she was a close friend of Sue Fuller. Ms. Cunningham lives in Hampton Bays, New York.</p>

<p>Sue Fuller (1914-2006) was a printmaker and sculptor in New York City and Southampton, New York.  She served as Stanley William Hayter's assistant at Atelier 17 in New York City in the mid 1940s. Fuller later became known for three-dimensional constructions composed of string and in the 1960s patented a method for embedding thread constructions in plastic.</p>

<scopecontent> 
<p>All but two letters are addressed to Priscilla Cunningham. Most are from Sue Fuller or were sent jointly by Sue Fuller and Alice Crocker. A few of Fuller's letters are illustrated. Christmas cards sent by Fuller and Crocker were designed by Fuller and featured drawings of their cats.</p>

<p>Other correspondents are: Suzanne Folds McCullagh (Art Institute of Chicago), Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, Martha Lou Schove (Fuller's sister), Susan Teller Gallery, Aleko von C., and Women's Caucus for Art. Both Robert Stitt and Peter Difenbeck wrote about the memorial service for Fuller's good friend, John Leeper; Stitt sent related printed material. </p>

<p>One letter written by Priscilla Cunningham is about the condition of artwork stored in Fuller's attic and expresses concern about their eventual disposition. The other is addressed to a Museum of Modern Art curator asking why he never replied to her previous letters about Sue Fuller.</p>
