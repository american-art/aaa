            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The Holly Solomon Gallery was established in 1975 by Holly Solomon and her husband, Horace Solomon, at 392 West Broadway in New York City's SoHo area. The gallery focused on contemporary art.</p>
            <p>The gallery represented artists such as William Wegman, Nam June Paik, Laurie Anderson, and Robert Kushner. In 1983, the gallery moved uptown to 724 Fifth Ave at 57th, but then moved again in the early 1990s back downtown to SoHo at 172 Mercer Street. After the gallery closed Holly Solomon continued to deal art from the Chelsea Hotel until her death in 2002.</p>
            <p>Holly Solomon was born Hollis Dworken in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1934. She started college at Vassar College, and later transferred to Sarah Lawrence College where she graduated in 1955. In 1953 she married Horace Solomon. Holly Solomon was an aspiring stage actress and was enrolled at Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio shortly after moving to Manhattan. Although she was not a successful actress she and her husband began collecting art and were fans of the Pop Art movement. In 1969 the couple opened an alternative work and performance space for artists named 98 Greene Street Loft. The space provided a venue for poets, actors, and artists to work and perform. Solomon wrote and produced a five part documentary from performances at 98 Greene Street, and in 1972 it was shown at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. 98 Greene Street Loft closed in 1973. Holly Solomon was also a proponent of the Pattern and Decoration, or "P and D", art movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many of the artists featured in her gallery were involved in the P and D movement including Robert Kushner, Kim MacConnel, Ned Smyth, and Brad Davis.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The records of Holly Solomon Gallery, a New York City gallery specializing in contemporary American art, measure 196.1 linear feet and date from circa 1948-2003. The gallery's activities are documented through alphabetical files, dealer files, subject files, artists' files, inventories, sales and loan records, administrative and financial records, printed materials, photographic materials of artwork and exhibitions, sound, video, and film recordings, and scattered electronic records. Also found are records of the alternative space, 98 Greene Street Loft, as well as Holly Solomon's personal papers.</p>
            <p>Alphabetical files span from 1991-2000 and contain correspondence with clients, galleries, and museums, as well as related documentation regarding loans, inquiries, sales, exhibitions, and travel plans. These general files were maintained separately from the gallery's subject and artists' files but may overlap in subject matter.</p>
            <p>The dealer files contain gallery correspondence to and from art dealers regarding inquiries on works and artists. These files are sparse and particular to the early 1980s. Subject files are mainly comprised of correspondence but also include printed materials, slides, and other related documents. Subjects include dealers, organizations, museums, clients, art fairs, travel, and projects that the gallery or Holly Solomon worked with.</p>
            <p>Artists' files consist of correspondence, printed material, slides, photographs, and scattered inventory records, regarding the sale of artwork, as well as shipping records and insurance claims. Also included is correspondence between the gallery and the artist. There is substantial documentation on artists Kim MacConnel, Nam June Paik, Izhar Patkin, William Wegman, and Joe Zucker. Inventory records include inventory lists created by Holly Solomon Gallery as well as an art inventory card file. Inventory cards note the title, date, and size of the work as well as the dates and movements of the work, and may include a photograph.</p>
            <p>Administrative records contain general office materials such as phone messages books, staff notebooks, exhibition guest books, and business diaries, exhibition documentation, notes, and mail from prospective artists. Records primarily cover the 1980s and 1990s. In addition to business diaries, Holly Solomon also created "Dear Diary" binders which contain a collection of contact information and notes on clients and events. Some of these diaries were maintained for specific events.</p>
            <p>Sales and loan records consist of in and out sheets, consignments, and sales invoices. Also in this series are sales and loan logs and files that track the same information but from different access points, including sales by artist. Financial records document the financial activities of the galleries, apart from sales, and include shipping records, tax and insurance information, and accounting statements and reports. Also found in this series are bills, receipts, and several ledgers. Legal records primarily document issues with the landlord of the gallery space.</p>
            <p>Printed material consists of artist clippings, gallery exhibition catalogs, press releases, posters, and miscellaneous books, magazines, and clippings regarding the gallery. Included are clippings pertaining to the Pattern and Design art movement. Photographic material includes photographs and slides documenting artists' work and gallery exhibitions. Sound, video, and film recordings include artworks created by gallery artists, performances recorded live at the gallery, and the publicity Holly Solomon, the gallery and its artists received. The work of video artist Nam June Paik is highly represented through some of his video artworks, as well as television interviews with him. Prominent artists William Wegman and Laurie Anderson are also represented through original artworks and publicity. Publicity videos include Holly Solomon herself, being interviewed for television and documentaries.</p>
            <p>The records of 98 Greene Street Loft include a large quantity of sound, video, and film recordings of poetry readings, live music, art, and theatrical performances that took place from 1971-1973, as well as scattered paper records such as play scripts, photographs, a guest book from 1971, printed material, and posters.</p>
            <p>Holly Solomon's personal papers consist of biographical documents, correspondence, memorabilia, printed material, motion picture film, and photographs collected by Holly Solomon throughout her life. Included are school records, letters, notes and cards from friends and artists she represented at her gallery, photographs, invitations, event fliers, and other mementos. Printed material, mostly magazines and newspapers document her accomplishments.</p>

Some of the correspondence includes printed materials, slides, and other related documents. These files were maintained separately from the gallery's subject and artists' files for any correspondence that did not have enough bulk to warrant its own file. There may also be some overlap with Series 3: Subject Files and Series 4: Artists' Files for items that were accidentally filed in these general files instead of into the proper subject or artist file. Additional correspondence can also be found within the dealer files, administrative records, and financial and legal records.</p>

                    <p>The subject files are mainly comprised of correspondence but also include printed materials, slides, and other related documents. The files span the life of the gallery from 1975 to 2002. Subjects include dealers, organizations, museums, clients, art fairs, travel, and projects that the gallery or Holly Solomon worked with. Researchers should note that some artists' information is contained within this series, and these files should be consulted along with files in Series 4: Artists' Files. There is significant coverage on Holly Solomon's work with the Art Dealer's Association of America, as well as the gallery's participation in events like FIAC (International Contemporary Art Fair), and the gallery's relationship with Museum of Modern Art (MOMA.)</p>

                    <p>This series contains various inventory lists created by Holly Solomon Gallery as well as an art inventory card file. Inventory cards note the title, date, and size of the work as well as the dates and movements of the work. Some cards also include a Polaroid of the work of art. Researchers should note that scattered inventory cards may also be housed in Series 4: Artists' Files. The inventory cards span the life of the gallery, from 1975 to 2000. Inventory lists include print outs of the gallery inventory, logs kept to track works by artist, gallery checklists and stocklists, inventory lists for Holly Solomon Editions as well as inventories of Holly Solomon's personal collection.</p>

                    <p>Administrative records contain general office materials such as phone messages books, notebooks used by staff, exhibition guest books, and business diaries. Records primarily cover the 1980s and 1990s. Business diaries are in day calendar format and contain appointment, contact, and event information. Tucked and stapled into the books are business cards, invitations, announcements, and occasionally correspondence. Each diary is one calendar year and some years have more than one diary while other years are missing. Also found are diaries used only for Holly Solomon Editions; a Holly Solomon Editions stamp on the inside cover page designates the diary's use.</p>
                    <p>The "Dear Diary" files parallel the business diaries but are not specifically calendar oriented. These diaries were compiled in binders by Holly Solomon, arranged by month and year, and contain a collection of contact information and notes on clients and events. Some of the diaries were maintained for a specific event, such as the Armory Art Fair of 1999. Researchers should note that additional "Dear Diary" materials may be contained within specific event folders found in Series 3: Subject Files. Diary material has been removed from binders into archival folders, but the original order has been maintained.</p>
                    <p>Exhibition binders found in this series contain layout and artist information for exhibitions in the early 1980s. Also found are boxes of unsorted mail and other documents that were never filed, mail from artists seeking representation, artists' biographies, and a file of Holly's notes.</p>

                    <p>The sales and loan records consist of in and out sheets, consignments, and sales invoices. In and out sheets tracked works as they moved in and out of the gallery and are limited to the date span of 1994-2000. For similar information please see the card files in Series 5: Inventory Records. Invoice records are divided between works that were on consignment and those works which were not; invoices date from 1978-2001 while the consignment invoices date from 1978-2000. Also in this series are sales and loan logs and files that track the same information but from different search points, including sales by artist. Files regarding Holly Solomon Editions invoicing are labeled as such.</p>

                    <p>Invoices are arranged by invoice number in ascending numerical order, which also follows a chronological order. The invoices have three numbering sequences due to changes in invoicing practices in the gallery. Material has been removed from binders into archival folders, but the original order has been maintained.</p>

                    <p>Photographic material includes photographs and slides documenting artists' work and gallery exhibitions. Found here are black and white and color photographs, including many polaroids, arranged by artist or by subject. Photographs primarily depict artwork, artwork installed for a gallery exhibition, or gallery performances. This series contains very few photographs of artists. The amount of material found within these files is varied and researchers should note that some photographic material can also be found in files in Series 4: Artists' Files. While most slides are housed separately, photograph files may also include scattered slides, as well as negatives and transparencies. The majority of files are by artist, but there are also files of photographs by subject. Subjects include various exhibitions, gallery flood damage, and events. Of note are photographs from the opening of the gallery's first exhibition in 1975.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement note</head>
                    <p>The series is arranged as 2 subseries:</p>
                    <p>
                        <list>
                            <item>10.1: Photographs, circa 1969-2000</item>
                            <item>10.2: Slides, circa 1975-2000</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Photographs by artist and slides by artist are in alphabetical order by artists' last name. Among the photographs arranged by artist items may be arranged by year, exhibition, performance, or format, while other files have no particular arrangement. The slides series is arranged in three ways: in folders arranged alphabetically by artist, in binders alphabetically by artist, and in slide boxes by artist. The first set was marked as a duplicate set and most likely mimics what is in the alphabetical binders.</p>

                    <p>Holly Solomon's personal papers consist of biographical documents, correspondence, memorabilia, printed material, motion picture film, and photographs collected by Holly Solomon throughout her life. The earliest materials include high school mementos and both her high school and college yearbooks, while later items include notes and cards from friends and artists she represented at her gallery. The boxes of personal correspondence, memorabilia and photographs are not sorted or organized any particular order. Included are postcards, telegrams, letters, photographs of friends and family, invitations, and event fliers.</p>
                    <p>Motion picture films include one short reel of black and white 16mm and a color Super 8mm (400 ft.) of Holly Solomon and others who are unidentified. Also found are three film reels (16mm, color) of a golfer. This series also includes legal documents regarding Solomon's 1990 divorce and a collection of printed material, mostly magazines and newspapers covering her accomplishments. The printed materials range from the 1950s through her death in 2002. The guest books from her 2002 memorial service at the Guggenheim are also included.</p>

                    <p>This series is comprised of recordings collected by the Holly Solomon Gallery. The content of the recordings are both about the gallery itself, and the artists it represented. The series is organized into artworks created by gallery artists, performances recorded live at the gallery, and the publicity Holly Solomon, the gallery and its artists received. The recordings range from before the gallery's opening in 1975 until after its closure in 2002, with most recordings coming out of the 80s and 90s. The work of video artist Nam June Paik is highly represented within the series through some of his actual video artworks, as well as through numerous documentaries and television interviews with him. Prominent artists William Wegman and Laurie Anderson are both represented through original artworks and publicity. Exhibition annoucements and gallery installation instructions accompany some of Anderson's sound cassettes used in her gallery shows. Also included are six empty cassette cases of hers with poems on the covers. Many of the publicity videos are of Holly Solomon herself, being interviewed for television and documentaries as early as 1989 for an episode of
