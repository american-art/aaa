            <p>Alexander Archipenko (1887-1964) was the son of an engineer/inventor and grandson of an icon painter. Among the first modern sculptors of the 20th century to be associated with the Cubist movement, Archipenko was known for his innovative use of concave space. His major contribution was the realization of negative form through use of a hole to create a contrast of solid and void. His sculpto-paintings united form and color; begun in 1912, these polychromed constructions are among the earliest mixed-media works known, and sometimes incorporated objects. Eventually, his Cubist-inspired work evolved into the simplified, abstract shapes for which he is best known. Although known primarily as a sculptor, Archipenko produced paintings, drawings, and prints as well.</p>
            <p>At age 15, Archipenko began studying art at the University of Kiev in his native city; he was expelled three years later for criticizing the teachers. He then went to Moscow where he worked on his own and exhibited in several group shows; his first solo exhibition was held in the Ukraine in 1906.</p>
            <p>Archipenko made Paris his home from 1908 until the outbreak of World War I. Soon after his arrival, he enrolled in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts; this association lasted but two weeks, and marked the end of Archipenko's formal training. He continued to study art by spending large amounts of time visiting art museums and painting on his own. During this period, he began exhibiting in the Salon des Independents with the Cubists, and as a member of the "Section d'Or" participated in that group's exhibitions. His first one-man exhibition in Germany was held at the Folkwant Museum (1912) and his work was featured in the Armory Show (1913).</p>
            <p>In 1912, at the age of 25, Archipenko established his first art school in Paris. He spent the war years working quietly outside of Nice, and soon afterwards circulated an extensive exhibition of his works throughout Europe. In 1921, Archipenko settled in Berlin, opened an art school there, and married sculptor Angelica Bruno-Schmitz, who was known professionally as Gela Forster.</p>
            <p>Archipenko's reputation was solidly established and the majority of his ground-breaking work - adaptation of Cubist ideas to sculpture, sculpto-paintings and incorporation of negative space in sculpture - was accomplished prior to his 1923 arrival in the United States. One of his most innovative works executed in America was the Archipentura, invented circa 1924 and patented in 1927, a machine with rolling cylinders that displayed "animated paintings" using motion and light. Other creations of note are carved Lucite sculptures, illuminated from within, that were executed in the mid-1940s.</p>
            <p>Upon settling in the United States in 1923, Archipenko opened his art school in New York City; a summer school was established in Woodstock, New York the following year. Within a few years, Archipenko purchased land near Woodstock and began construction of a home, personal studio, and buildings for the school. At various times during the 1930s, Archipenko resided in Chicago and Los Angeles, and operated schools while living in those cities. For many years during the 1940s, Angelica served on the sculpture faculty at the Escuela de Belles Artes in San Miguel Allende, Mexico.</p>
            <p>In addition to running his own schools, Archipenko taught at a number of colleges and universities, where he ran workshops, and served as a visiting professor. He wrote and lectured extensively about his philosophy of art and theories of creativity, publishing several articles and a book, 
                <emph render="italic">Archipenko: Fifty Creative Years, 1908-1958</emph> (1960).</p>
            <p>Angelica Archipenko died in 1957. Three years later Archipenko married sculptor Frances Gray, a former student. During the early 1960s, the couple traveled extensively on a lecture tour that accompanied a solo exhibition to several German cities. Archipenko died in New York City, February 25, 1964.</p>

Professional correspondence is with dealers, curators, scholars, collectors, colleges and universities concerning exhibitions, sales and commissions, loans, and teaching and lecture engagements.</p>
            <p>Archipenko wrote and lectured extensively about his philosophy of art, art in nature, and theories concerning creativity and the universe. His papers include manuscripts, drafts, notes and supporting materials for his book published in 1960, 
                <emph render="italic">Archipenko: Fifty Creative Years, 1908-1958</emph>. Similar documentation of unpublished writings, as well as notes, outlines, and some transcripts of lectures and talks are also in the series.</p>
            <p>Records concerning the Archipenko Art School are sparse, with only one photograph of students in Berlin, 1921. Surviving records include printed matter, a cashbook, student roster, and scrapbook containing photographs, printed matter, and a typescript copy of a statement by Archipenko, "How I Teach." Most of this material focuses on the New York and Woodstock schools, with only a few items concerning Chicago. In addition, files regarding Archipenko's teaching activities at schools other than his own include course descriptions, student rosters, grades, and printed matter.</p>
            <p>Financial records consist of banking records, paid bills, and miscellaneous items. Paid bills include invoices and receipts for art supplies, shipping, and storage. Among the miscellaneous items are price lists, royalties paid by the Museum of Modern Art for 
                <emph render="italic">Woman Combing Her Hair</emph>, and sales records.</p>
            <p>Nine scrapbooks contain clippings, exhibition announcements and catalogs, lecture notices, advertisements and brochures of the Archipenko Art School, and a small number of photographs. Printed matter consists primarily of clippings about Archipenko and exhibition catalogs with related announcements and invitations. Miscellaneous items include books about Archipenko, catalogs of museum collections containing works by Archipenko, and reproductions. Of special interest is a brochure about the Multiplex Advertising Machine that bears a similarity to the Archipentura, an "apparatus for displaying Changeable Pictures" Archipenko invented circa 1924 and patented in 1927.</p>
            <p>Photographs are of people, Archipenko's travels and miscellaneous places, exhibitions, works of art, events, and miscellaneous subjects. Five photograph albums mainly document travels. Slides and transparencies include black and white lantern slides probably used to illustrate lectures.</p>

                    <p>Biographical materials include a wide variety of records concerning Alexander Archipenko, his first wife, Angelica Archipenko (an artist known professionally as Gela Forster), and his second wife, Frances Archipenko Gray (a.k.a. Frances Gray Archipenko). Among these records are ephemera, funeral guest registers, and real estate records including floor plans of their house in Woodstock, N.Y. and a proposed bequest to the Ukrainian Art and Literary Club. There are also various legal documents, including residency permits issued during Archipenko's years in France, passports, and wills. Articles by and about Angelica Archipenko include an article about Bali (in German), her art and acting careers, and exhibition and drama reviews; also included is a color reproduction of her portrait by Leo Katz. A catalog of Escuela Universitaria de Bellas Artes in San Allende, Mexico, describes the sculpture course taught by Angelica Archipenko and contains photographs of students' work. There is a recorded and transcribed interview with Angelica on a sound tape reel (1/4 in.), and Angelica's reminiscences of Walter Spies and excerpts from her diaries are also included. There are also exhibition catalogs and a will in the materials related to Frances Archipenko Gray.</p>

                    <p>This series, arranged chronologically, includes both personal and professional correspondence. Among the personal correspondents are relatives and friends in the Ukraine, Archipenko's wife Angelica during her extended stays in California and Mexico, and other women. Professional correspondence is with dealers, curators, scholars, collectors, colleges and universities concerning exhibitions, sales and commissions, loans, teaching, and lecture engagements. Also included are routine requests from prospective students for information about the Archipenko School or summer courses. Correspondence post-dating Archipenko's death concerns exhibitions, sales, and unfinished business.</p>
                    <p>Additional correspondence is included with Series 3: Subject Files, which includes significant correspondence with the Museum of Modern Art and others concerning "?That is Why I Request to Remove My Art from the Museum of Modern Art by Alexander Archipenko," 1943-1944.</p>

                        <emph render="italic">Archipenko: Fifty Creative Years, 1908-1958</emph> (Tekhne Publications, Inc., 1960). Manuscripts, drafts, notes and supporting materials for 
                        <emph render="italic">Fifty Creative Years</emph> survive, along with similar documentation of unpublished writings. Also included are notes, outlines, and some transcripts and audio/visual recordings of lectures and talks. Recordings are on 1 sound cassette, 2 sound tape reels (1/4 in.), and 1 film reel. General notes are extensive and cover a variety of subjects; included with these are names, addresses, and phone numbers for friends, acquaintances, and professional associates in books, a card file, and loose scraps of paper.

                    <p>With the exception of one photograph taken in Berlin, 1921, records documenting Archipenko's schools and teaching career are confined to his years in the United States. They focus mainly on his New York City school and the Woodstock summer school, with only a few items representing Chicago.</p>
                    <p>The scrapbook contains advertisements and circulars for the Archipenko School of Art, including summer and evening schools, 1932-1946. There are also clippings and other printed matter, including exhibition announcements and catalogs about the Archipenko Art School (1928-1946), Arko Studio (1929), and former students (1931-1941), and a typescript of "How I Teach," a statement by Archipenko. Photographs of students are a group portrait of a class at his school in Berlin, 1921, students in a ceramic workshop, sculpture studios, bronze casting plaster casting, and summer classes, 1923 and 1930. Other photographs are of a pottery kiln, 1930, and Woodstock studio and school buildings, 1930s-1946, including construction views.</p>
                    <p>Files regarding Archipenko's teaching activities at schools other than his own include course descriptions, student rosters, grades, and printed matter. There are also 3 video recordings of Archipenko with students; these recordings are on film reels (3.5 in. and 3 in.).</p>
                    <p>A small amount of material relating to the Archipenko School and his teaching activities elsewhere is scattered throughout his papers. Series 2: Correspondence includes requests from prospective students for school circulars and other information, correspondence with the various institutions where he was a guest instructor, and correspondence about school advertising. A variety of school related printed matter, as well as clippings about Archipenko's students and their work, and photographs of student exhibitions and student work are included in Series 7: Scrapbooks. Series 11: Photographs contains views of students, classes, and the facilities at Woodstock.</p>

                    <p>Among the "Clippings About/Mentioning Archipenko, or Containing Reproductions" are feature articles, reviews, school advertisements, and obituaries from newspapers and magazines. "Exhibition Catalogs, Announcements, etc." are for solo exhibitions and group shows and may include such items as press releases, invitations to openings, posters, and broadsides. A small number of catalogs are from shows where Archipenko served as a juror; also, included are exhibition catalogs of other artists, many of them Archipenko's former students. Among the miscellaneous items of particular interest is an undated brochure describing the Multiplex Advertising Machine, a device similar to the Archipentura, an "apparatus for displaying Changeable Pictures" invented by Archipenko circa 1924 and patented in 1927.</p>
                    <p>Additional printed matter, much of which duplicates items filed with this series, can be found in Series 5: Teaching, and Series 7: Scrapbooks.</p>

                    <p>Studio and informal portraits of Alexander and Angelica Archipenko are by Frans Fiedlin, A. Elnain, Helen Balfour-Morrison, Cy Harriman, Gus Shroeder, A. Luckwin, Lary Colwell, Li Osborne, H. Tarr, and unknown photographers. They include a portrait of Angelica as a young girl, a contemporary copy print of Angelica with her father and sister, circa 1904, and several studio portraits made in Germany. Other people pictured include friends and possibly relatives, the majority of whom are unidentified; also, Frances Gray Archipenko, the second wife.</p>
                    <p>Nine photograph albums, 1925-1953, mainly document travel. Vol. 1, May-Nov. 1925, includes photographs and scenic post cards of Niagara Falls, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, and Canada; other subjects are friends (many identified), cowboys, Indians, cattle branding, landscapes, camping, and horses. Vol. 2, Aug.-Sept. 1925, contains photographs of a camping trip in Canada, with views of the landscape, friends (many identified), and activities; also included are pictures taken in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Arizona. Photographs of interest in vol. 3, 1925-1953, are Archipenko's first car, 1925; friends (many identified); Woodstock construction, 1930s; studio, kiln, and metal casting facilities, 1940s; Archipenko working with lucite, 1946; fire at Woodstock cottage, 1953; and two self-portraits painted by Angelica. Vol. 4, 1930s mainly records a trip to Bali and includes photographs of Walter Spies; also included are views aboard the 
                        <emph render="italic">Derffling</emph>, Suez Canal, Ceylon, Java, China, Japan, Philippines, Hawaii, California, and Archipenko at Mills College. Vol. 5, 1938-1941, consists of photographs taken in Mexico, mainly of San Miguel Allende and the Escuela Universitaria de Bellas Artes where Angelica Archipenko taught sculpture; included are views of classes, faculty, students and student work; also, views of Taxco, Mexico City, and Morelia. A fair number of photographs from the albums were duplicated for various purposes over the years, and these copies are now filed with the appropriate subseries.</p>
                    <p>There are a large number of slides, transparencies, negatives, and 86 lantern slides, and 80 glass plates. There may be prints of the vast majority of the negatives, though there are not negatives for every photograph in the collection. Most likely, the black and white lantern slides of ancient art, ethnographic objects, and biological and other specimens were used to illustrate a lecture or may have been collected as possible illustrations for a book.</p>
                    <p>Other photographs can be found with Series 4: Writings, which includes a few photographs collected as research notes or intended as illustrations; Series 5: Teaching, includes a scrapbook of the Archipenko Art School that contains pictures of students, and classes and facilities at Woodstock; and Series 7: Scrapbooks, with photographs of exhibition installations, and groups of people including students at Mills College.</p>
