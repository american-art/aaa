            <p>Materials received a preliminary level of arrangement at some point after donation and were later microfilmed. The collection was processed to a minimal level and a finding aid prepared by Judy Ng in 2014, with funding provided by the Terra Foundation for American Art. The Archives of American Art has implemented minimal processing tactics when possible in order to increase information about and access to more of our collections.</p>
            <p>Minimal processing included arrangement to the series and folder levels. Generally, items within folders were simply verified with folder titles, but not arranged further. The collection was rehoused in archival containers and folders.</p>

            <p>Painter and printmaker Anne Goldthwaite (1869-1944) lived and worked in Alabama and New York, New York. Goldthwaite was born in Montgomery, Alabama, spent her childhood in Dallas, Texas, and with the encouragement of family, moved to New York to pursue her art studies in 1892. There, she studied art with her mentor, Walter Shirlaw, at the National Academy of Design. In 1906, Goldthwaite traveled to Paris and became part of the circle of modern artists who founded the Acad√©mie Moderne. While her friends were exploring modernist styles, her style of painting remained figurative. She returned to America in 1913, and her work was selected for exhibition in the Armory Show.</p>
            <p>From 1922 to 1944, Goldthwaite taught at the Art Students League and received private portrait commissions. During the summers, she would return to Montgomery, Alabama, which remained a rich source for her works of genre scenes of the south. Goldthwaite served as president of the New York Society of Women Artists from 1937-1938 and died in New York City in 1944.</p>
