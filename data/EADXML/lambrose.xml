<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Rose Lamb (1843-1927) was a portrait painter and drawing instructor of Boston, Massachusetts. Lamb was born in Boston to a prominent family and was a student of William Morris Hunt and Helen Knowlton during the 1870s.  Though she did not exhibit often during her lifetime, she was a successful portraitist specializing in portraits of children. Lamb was an active member of Boston society, befriending many artists, writers, and other cultural figures, and her portraits were in great demand among prominent Boston families.  She traveled to Europe in 1881, 1890, and 1914, perhaps taking art classes while there in 1881.  In 1884, and possibly later, she assisted George Bartlett as a drawing instructor at the South Boston School of Art.  In 1900 she suffered a severe illness and stopped painting.  For the remainder of her life she instead pursued travel and social activities.  Rose Lamb died in 1927.</p>
