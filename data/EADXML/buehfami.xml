<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Born in 1865 in Germany, Karl Albert Buehr was a painter of genre scenes, portraits, and Impressionist landscapes.  He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Julian Academy in France and the London School of Art.  From 1899 to 1902 he lived in Holland, and then spent the first decade of the twentieth century at Giverny, France.  A member of the Giverny artists, Buehr exhibited widely in Europe.  Buehr became a U.S. citizen and served in the U.S. Cavalry during the Spanish-American War.  In Chicago he became a highly respected teacher at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and one of the city's most popular painters.  Buehr died in Chicago in 1952. </p>
<p>Karl's wife, Mary Hess Buehr, was born in Chicago in 1871.  She was a painter who studied in Holland and France, and held three exhibitions at the Paris Salon. Mary specialized in miniatures and decorative paintings.  She was also a lithographer, lecturer, and teacher active in Chicago.  She died in Orwell, Vermont, in 1962.  </p>
<p>Their children, Kathleen and George F. Buehr, were both artists as well.  George, known for his watercolors and collages, was director of museum education and a lecturer at the Art Institute of Chicago.  He died in Chicago in 1983 at age 78.   Kathleen was born in Chicago in 1902.  A graduate of the Art Institute of Chicago, Kathleen was painter and author.  Several of her articles are found in the papers, including "My Most Unforgettable Character," published in 1969 in <emph render="italic">The Reader's Digest</emph>.</p>
