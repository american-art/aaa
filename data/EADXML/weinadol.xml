            <p>American sculptor, Adolph Alexander Weinman was born on December 11, 1870 in Germany and came to New York City in 1880. At the age of fifteen, he attended evening classes at Cooper Union. He later studied at the Art Students League. When he was twenty years old, he entered the studio of Philip Martiny and later worked with Olin Warner, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Charles Henry Niehaus, and Daniel Chester French. In 1904, Weinman opened his own studio, and in the same year created the 
                <emph render="italic">Destiny of the Red Man</emph> for the St. Louis Exposition. In 1923, he moved his studio to Forest Hills, New York, where he lived until his death.</p>
            <p>Among Weinman's more notable sculpture commissions are the 
                <emph render="italic">General Alexander Macomb</emph> Memorial in Detroit, Michigan, 
                <emph render="italic">Alexander Johnston Cassatt</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Samuel Rea</emph> for the Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal in New York City, the 
                <emph render="italic">Seated Lincoln</emph> for Hodgenville, Kentucky, and sculptural group 
                <emph render="italic">Riders of the Dawn</emph> at Brookgreen Gardens, South Carolina. In 1915, he designed 
                <emph render="italic">The Rising Sun</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Descending Night</emph> fountains for the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. In the following year he designed the "Mercury" dime and "Walking Liberty" half dollar for the U. S. Mint. Weinman also created friezes for the U. S. Supreme Court building, and pediments for the National Archives building, the U. S. Post Office Department Building, and for the Jefferson Memorial, all in Washington, D. C.</p>
            <p>Weinman was a member of many organizations, including the National Sculpture Society, of which he was president from 1927 to 1930, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Design, and the New York City Art Commission.</p>
            <p>Adolph A. Weinman died on August 8, 1952, in Port Chester, New York.</p>

                    <p>Letterpress books of Weinman's outgoing letters and unbound letters exchanged with colleagues and family members. Arranged in chronological order, the letters often refer to miscellaneous projects, but are not organized according to project. Many of the letters in the Letterpress books are written on very thin tissue paper and are barely legible. Additional project-specific correspondence is organized with Project Files.</p>

                    <p>Numerous project files for commissioned work and other sculptures arranged chronologically, with undated ones arranged at the beginning of the series. In some instances the name of the project or work of art has been supplied by the processing archivist based on image/s found in the files; known titles of works of art appear in italics. The majority of the project files contain only photographs, but several also contain a variety of documents related to the project, such as correspondence, contracts, financial records, notes, drawings, printed material, and photographs.</p>
                    <p>Also found within the series are numerous glass plate negatives housed separately and closed to researchers, most of which have prints in their respective files and are so noted with a See Also reference. Oversized materials are also housed separately and noted with See Also references.</p>
