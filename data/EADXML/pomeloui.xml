            <p>Chicago art conservator Louis Pomerantz (1919-1988), established and operated the conservation lab at the Art Institute of Chicago and then maintained a private practice conducting conservation work for individual collectors and various museums and art institutions in the midwest.</p>
            <p>Pomerantz had originally intended to be an artist and enrolled at the Art Students League. After serving in World War II, he returned to Europe to study conservation as an apprentice to a private restorer in Paris, followed by a year spent working under the chief restorer at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, and study at the Courtauld Institute and the National Gallery in London. As head of the Art Institute of Chicago's first conservation lab from 1956-1961, Pomerantz employed new and emerging techniques such as powerful binocular microscopes, ultra-violet, infra-red and X-ray machines to study paintings, and a hot table to bond new canvasses to support old ones. Following his resignation from the Art Institute of Chicago to pursue his private practice, Pomerantz organized conservation training programs, and wrote widely on conservation. He served on the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) and was a member of the committee which adopted the AIC's first code of ethics for art conservators in May 1967. He became consultant to various art and natural history museums including the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where he formed part of the conservation team that completed an extensive renovation of the museum's Javanese gamelan ensemble composed of 23 brass and wood musical instruments.The gamelan was presented and played for the first time since 1893 in 1978, following the restoration.</p>
            <p>Pomerantz also organized several museum exhibitions on conservation, including 
                <emph render="italic">Know What You See</emph>, which was shown at more than 100 museums around the United States, Canada and Mexico, as part of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES).</p>

            <p>The collection was processed to a minimal level and a finding aid prepared by Stephanie Ashley in 2014-2015, with funding provided by the Terra Foundation for American Art. The Archives of American Art has implemented minimal processing tactics when possible in order to increase information about and access to more of our collections.</p>
            <p>Minimal processing included arrangement to the series, subseries, and folder levels. Generally, items within folders were simply verified with folder titles, but not arranged further. The collection was rehoused in archival containers and folders, but not all staples and clips were removed.</p>
            <p>Glass plate negatives were re-housed in 2015 with a grant provided by the Smithsonian Collections Care and Preservation Fund.</p>

They include correspondence with George Stout of the Worcester Art Museum, and Veterans Administration records.</p>
                    <p>The series includes six folders of correspondence with influential conservation scientist, Robert L.

McCrone; and correspondence with other art conservators including Anton J. Konrad, Russell J. Quandt, Bernard Rabin, Suzanne Sack, Nathan Stolow, Jean Volkmer, and Phoebe Dent Weil.</p>

                    <p>Project/Client Files document Pomerantz's conservation on artwork for individuals, museums, institutions, and private companies. Files typically include preliminary condition reports and recommendations for treatment; agreement and release forms authorizing treatment; receipts for financial transactions, related correspondence, and in some cases photographic material.</p>
                    <p>Series includes files for clients for whom Pomerantz did a large volume of conservation work including Leigh Block, Chicago Board of Trade, Nathan Cummings, Edgar W. Garbisch, Nelson Harris, Jerome Hill, International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, Arnold H. Maremont, Milwaukee Art Museum, Ohio Historical Society, United States Postal Service, University of Iowa Museum of Art, and the Wichita Art Museum Ronald P. Murdock Collection.</p>
                    <p>Art Institute of Chicago files are relatively extensive and include records documenting conservation department activities, committees and budgets, in addition to individual projects conducted by the Institute's conservation department.</p>
                    <p>Also found here are extensive files documenting Pomerantz's work on the Gamelan collection at the Field Museum of Natural History, including condition reports, background and research material, sound recordings, photographs, and news clippings.</p>
                    <p>A group of folders at the end of the series documents client projects that remained unfinished when Pomerantz died in 1988.</p>
                    <p>The series includes 2 sound recordings related to an exhibition on 2 sound tape reels.</p>

                        <p>This series does not include Pomerantz's contributions at professional events, which can be found in Series 4: Writings and Notes, but does document his attendance and involvement in events such as AIC and International Institute for Conservation of Historical and Artistic Works annual meetings and other conferences primarily in the midwest and California. The records document some of the most prominent and pressing issues in art conservation during the 1960s-1980s.</p>
                        <p>Records include committee material such as lists of meeting attendees, calls for papers, memoranda, correspondence and notes, conference handouts and other printed material, and 62 sound cassettes and 5 sound tape reels of conference presentations and events.</p>

                    <p>Minimal processing did not allow time for full arrangement of the photographic material and re-housing of the slides in this series. Where possible, Pomerantz's original groupings and labels were preserved and are reflected in the Container Listing. Some slides, including the bulk of the project/client slides, are unsorted, and include glass slides mounted in an unorthodox method devised by Pomerantz. Some, however, were removed to archival housing and existing labels were saved or transcribed where possible. Original groupings for otherwise unidentified slides are represented, where possible, by slide containers and dividers.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Photographic material primarily documents conservation treatments and techniques through photographs, slides, negatives, glass slides, and 5 glass plate negatives. Many images show Pomerantz and others engaged in conservation work and artwork at various stages in the conservation process.</p>
                    <p>Photographs of artists include Tessa Macintosh, Ulfert Wilke, and a signed photo of Georgia O'Keeffe.</p>
                    <p>Photos of Pomerantz at work include 2 photos of him at the Winterthur Museum working with conservator Joyce Hill Stoner who was instrumental in organizing the
                        <emph render="italic"> Know What You See</emph> exhibition. Additional material showing Pomerantz at work can be found throughout the series.</p>
                    <p>Travel slides document Pomerantz's travels to Israel where subjects include a museum visit, the Dead Sea, Damascus Gate, Independence Park, and Purim.</p>
                    <p>Slide carousels contain slides used by Pomerantz in lectures and presentations, including presentations on the cleaning of a Robert Motherwell mural at the University of Iowa, and conservation of the George Sugarman sculpture 
                        <emph render="italic">Ramdam</emph>.</p>
                    <p>"Slide notebooks" consist of slides documenting conservation techniques that were removed from unlabeled binders, transferred to archival housing in their original order and numbered sequentially according to their original binder groupings. Loose slides were removed from loose notebook slide pages and rehoused immediately after this group as they appeared to belong together.</p>
                    <p>Project/client photographic material documents conservation treatment by project/client and is largely unsorted with the original boxes or labels preserved. Also found are large format X-rays and corresponding prints.</p>
                    <p>Project/client negatives are 8 x 10s of paintings from collections belonging to individuals including Lou Block, Nathan Cummings, Epstein, and Arnold H. Maremont.</p>
                    <p>Photographs and slides of artwork that do not appear to document specific damage or conservation work are housed at the end of the series.</p>
                    <p>5 glass plate negatives are housed separately and are closed to researchers.</p>
