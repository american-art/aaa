            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Ruth Bowman (b. 1923) is an art historian and museum educator who worked in New York City and Los Angeles. She is known for her interest in using new communications technology for museum education, discovering Arshile Gorky's long forgotten murals at Newark Airport, and expertise in the work of Thomas Anshutz.</p>
            <p>A graduate of Bryn Mawr College (B.A. 1944), where she had studied art history and classical archaeology, Ruth Bowman began a museum career in New York as an assistant curator at the Jewish Museum in the early 1960s. From 1963-1974 Ruth Bowman served as curator of the York University Art Collection and was involved in its transition to the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center. Bowman wrote her master's thesis on Philadelphia artist Thomas Pollock Anshutz and received a degree from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University in 1971. During this same period, she was a staff lecturer at The Museum of Modern Art and taught art history in divisions of New York University. She was the instructor for a "Sunrise Semester" 20th century American art course broadcast nationally on CBS.</p>
            <p>In 1974 Bowman and her family moved to California and she began an association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as Director of Education. She attended summer courses in arts administration at Harvard University (1975) and similar training provided by the British Arts Council (1976). She taught at University of California Santa Barbara, as well as at California State University at Fullerton and Long Beach. Bowman was active in the Council of the American Association of Museums (vice president), the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles (vice president), and has served as a consultant to several museums and a corporate collection.</p>
            <p>Ruth Bowman with her friend Harry Kahn (1916-1999) developed a collection of self-portraits by 20th century American artists, which she donated to the National Portrait Gallery in 2002. Mrs. Bowman is the widow of R. Wallace Bowman and currently resides in New York City.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The papers of art historian and museum educator Ruth Bowman are dated 1936-2006, bulk 1963-1999, and measure 21.1 linear feet. Professional correspondence and subject files document Bowman's relationships with colleagues and reflect her interests, activities including curatorial work, and accomplishments as a museum educator. Writing and related research materials include her thesis, "Thomas Pollock Anshutz, 1851-1912" (M.A., Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1971), and unfinished projects. Also found are interviews conducted by Bowman with a wide range of individuals for a variety of purposes.</p>
            <p>Biographical materials consist of certificates, resumes, and a few photographs of Ruth Bowman. Correspondence concerns Bowman's professional activities and interests. Among the most frequent correspondents are: American Association of Museums, Craft and Folk Art Museum (Los Angeles), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Museum of Modern Art.</p>
            <p>Writings by Ruth Bowman, published and unpublished, include a thesis and articles about Thomas Pollock Anshutz, catalogs for American Federation of Arts and The Newark Museum exhibitions, lectures, as well as articles about museum education and visual arts programs. Research relates to her writings about Anshutz, and to unrealized projects concerning Anshutz, Cézanne, Eakins, Picasso, and other subjects. Also found are two brief writings about Bowman.</p>
            <p>Subject files--general subjects, artists' files, Ruth Bowman activities, and "Sunrise Semester"--contain the majority of Bowman's professional correspondence along with printed material, writings, photographs, and sound recordings. Among the most thoroughly documented general subjects are: The Brooklyn Museum's Trustees Retreat, Canadian Museums Association, a 1981 Craft Symposium, International Network for the Arts, Long Beach Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, "Museum Directors' Forum", New York University Art Collection, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Council for the Arts. Artists' files are comprised mainly of printed material with a small amount of correspondence and some photographs. The Les Levine file consists of the first issue of 
                <emph render="italic">Art-Rite</emph> featuring a brief article about Levine on its cover; Thomas Wilfred's file includes information about Lumia. Ruth Bowman activities include lectures, radio and television appearances, and participation in professional events. "Sunrise Semester," a collaboration between CBS television and New York University, offered early morning courses for college credit. Ruth Bowman was the instructor for "20th Century American Art," which is documented by general information, scripts, and sound recordings of all 46 classes.</p>
            <p>Interviews conducted by Bowman are with English museum administrators and educators; people knowledgeable about a controversial proposal for an Annenberg Fine Arts Center at The Metropolitan Museum of Art; guests on KUSC radio shows "Sounds of Seeing" and "Live from Trump's"; and guests on the WNYC radio program "Views on Art." Interviews with miscellaneous individuals include Josef Albers, Hans Burkhardt, Carl Holty, Isamu Noguchi, and Helen Farr Sloan. Bowman interviewed a dozen American abstract artists, including Ilya Bolotowsky, Rosalind Bengelsdorf Browne, Burgoyne Diller, John Ferren, Carl Holty, Harry Holtzman, Ibram Lassaw, Jacques Lipchitz, Alice Mason, George McNeil, George L. K. Morris, and Ad Reinhardt for a thesis on the subject, but eventually wrote on a different topic. Two interviews with Bowman were conducted by Duncan MacDonald and an unidentified interviewer.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>This series is comprised mainly of published and unpublished writings by Ruth Bowman and related research materials pertaining to writings and contemplated projects that did not progress beyond research. Subjects include Thomas Pollock Anshutz, research on Cezanne, Thomas Eakins, Picasso, and miscellaneous topics.</p>
                    <p>Bowman first researched Anshutz for a student paper before deciding on her thesis subject, "Thomas Pollock Anshutz, 1851-1912" (Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1971). Notes and correspondence for the paper and thesis further expanded as she prepared articles and lectures, planned an exhibition, and began researching a catalogue raisonne. Much of the correspondence is with owners of paintings by Anshutz and includes requests for Bowman's opinions about unsigned works. Also included are many photographs, printed material, and photocopies of archival documents. A file titled "Addenda" contains information that became available after the thesis was completed.</p>
                    <p>Cezanne research was conducted for an article on the relationship between Cezanne's 
                        <emph render="italic">Nudes in a Landscape</emph> and Picasso's
                        <emph render="italic"> Des Demoiselles d'Avignon</emph>. Picasso research correspondence indicates Bowman was working on an article on the evolution of Picasso's early style; other letters focus on 
                        <emph render="italic">Des Demoiselles d'Avigon</emph> and are related to her Cezanne research. Miscellaneous topics concern Bowman's work as a curator of "Double Exposure" and "Murals Without Walls: Arshile Gorky's Aviation Murals Rediscovered." Other research concerns Barnes Lectures delivered at the New York University Club, the paintings of Vivienne Wechter, and notes for a brief article or catalog entry on Prendergast.</p>
                    <p>Writings by other authors are about Bowman.</p>

                    <p>Subject files reflect Bowman's professional interests, memberships, and activities. They contain varying combinations of correspondence, printed material, photographs, writings, and some audiovisual material. Among the most thoroughly documented subjects are: The Brooklyn Museum's Trustees Retreat, Canadian Museums Association, a 1981 Craft Symposium, International Network for the Arts, Long Beach Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum Directors' Forum, New York University Art Collection, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Council for the Arts at MIT. Almost all items dated prior to 1962 and after 1999 are printed material.</p>
                    <p>General subjects are those files measuring less than 0.5 linear feet.; included are 38 sound cassettes and 6 videocassettes (2 VHS, 4 U-Matic). Artists' files are comprised mainly of printed material with a small amount of correspondence and some photographs. The Les Levine file consists of the first issue of 
                        <emph render="italic">Art-Rite </emph> that featured on its cover "Found Object," a brief article by Levine. Also of note is Thomas Wilfred's file with information about Lumia, including material prepared by the Art Institute of Light, West Nyack, New York. The largest file, David Smith, contains mostly photocopied archival materials. Ruth Bowman's many professional activities are documented by a variety of printed materials. "Sunrise Semester," the first collaboration between network television (CBS) and a university (New York University), from 1957-1983 offered early morning televised courses for college credit. Ruth Bowman was the instructor for "Twentieth Century American Art," broadcast September 1972-January 1973. Scripts consist of slide lists for each class; recordings of all 46 classes are included (46 sound tape reels).</p>

                    <p>With two exceptions, the interviews were conducted by Ruth Bowman. She is the subject of two interviews, and one KUSC "Live from Trump's" radio program was hosted by Myra Livingston.</p>
                    <p>In 1976, while attending an arts administration program offered by the British Arts Council, Bowman inteviewed museum administrators and educators in England (6 sounds cassettes).</p>
                    <p>Serving as an advisor to Metroplitan Museum of Art Director Thomas Hoving, Bowman interviewed more than a dozen people in 1976 concerning the benefits, drawbacks, and ramifications of the Annenberg Fine Arts Center proposed for The Metropolitan Museum of Art (12 sound cassettes). The controversial plan aroused much concern and Annenberg eventually withdrew his offer.</p>
                    <p>Among the interviews with miscellaneous individuals (4 sound reels, 6 sound cassettes, and 2 transcripts) , of particular interest is an interview with Noguchi concerning a possible commission for a sculpture at Bryn Mawr College, his mother's alma mater. A 1974 interview with Bowman concerns her work at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p>
                    <p>Bowman was the host of "Sounds of Seeing," a radio show produced by KUSC radio in Los Angeles, 1979-1983. With funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, "Sounds of Seeing" aired Bowman's interviews with artists, art historians, museum curators and directors, conservators, local politicians, and others on a wide range of art related topics (7 sound reels and 69 sound cassettes). On "Live from Trump's," a KUSC radio program broadcast from Trump's Restaurant, Bowman conversed with guests about local exhibitions and other arts events.</p>
                    <p>Interviews with 12 American abstract artists were conducted by Ruth Bowman (Ruth Gurin at the time) as background research for her intended thesis on the subject. Plans changed, and the thesis she eventually wrote was "Thomas Pollock Anshutz, 1851-1912" (M.A., Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1971).</p>
                    <p>"Views on Art," her weekly radio show on WNYC, 1967-1973, featured interviews with artists, museum directors and curators, gallery owners and others who discussed their work and current exhibitions. Other topics covered include: art forgeries, underground movie making, museum management, art publishing, business and the arts, art and public relations, computers and the humanities, new art technologies, and trends in art education. (72 sound reels, 3 sound cassettes, and 1 transcript; digitized on 58 CDs).</p>

                    <p>Interviews concerning the Annenberg Fine Arts Center, interviews of miscellaneous individuals, and WNYC "Views on Art" radio programs are alphabetized by interviewee. Those with museum administrators and educators are arraned chronologically, as are the interviews for KUSC radio shows "Sounds of Seeing" and "Live From Trump's." "Sounds of Seeing" interviews are housed in 1 folder and 4 smaller boxes within Box 14. Additional interviews recorded for other purposes are scattered among the subject files (series 4).</p>
