<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Walter Tandy Murch (1907-1967) of Toronto, Canada, was a painter and art teacher.  His painting were primarily of still life subjects including machine parts, tools, broken dolls, and scientific equipment mingled with fruit, bread and fragments of rock as if seen through frosted glass.</p>
 
<p>Walter Tandy Murch was born on August 17, 1907, in Toronto, Canada, the son of Clara Louise Tandy and jeweller Walter Murch.  Following his studies of architectural drafting and woodworking at the Technical High School in Toronto, he studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto with Arthur Lismer from 1924 to 1927.  During the following year, Murch studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City with Arshile Gorky.  From 1927 to 1929, he studied with Von Schlegel and K. H. Miller at the Art Students League.  In 1930, Murch married Katharine Louise Scott.</p>

<p>From 1930 to 1933, Murch designed stained glass windows for Montague Castle, Inc., in New York City.  Following a lengthy painting trip to Mexico in 1934, Murch returned to New York City and earned a living painting murals, designing department store windows, and creating illustrations for various magazines including Fortune and Scientific American.</p>  

<p>Murch had his first solo exhibition at Betty Parsons' Wakefield Gallery in New York in 1941, and for many years Parsons was his principal dealer. Murch became a United States citizen in 1947.</p>

<p>Beginning in the 1950s, Murch taught at Pratt Institute, Columbia University, New York University, and at Boston University, and attended summer sessions at Yaddo and Skowhegan.  In 1966, the Rhode Island School of Design organized Murch's first major retrospective.</p>

<p>Murch's work is in the collections of the Barnes Foundation, Brooklyn Museum, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
