"Abstract painter and art dealer; Dana Point, Californa. McLaughlin was born and educated in Massachusetts. His extensive travels in China and Japan later were an important influence in his work as a dealer and in his art.

"Advertising designer and executive; New York, N.Y. Douglas Leigh (1902-1999) was dubbed ""The Man Who Lit Up New York"" in his New York Times obituary. He was responsible for festooning Broadway with miles of spectacular electrical signs, such as a steaming coffeepot, a winking penguin on a cake of ice for Kool cigarettes, and the giant Camel sign that puffed smoke rings from a Times Square sign from 1941 and 1967. These effects led to creating animated billboards, an innovation called the Leigh-EPOK animated, billboards matrix display, or EPOK. A light board illuminating hand-drawn animated films projected on a bank of photo-cells, introduced in 1935, cemented the association between animation and advertising. Leigh collaborated with Otto Mesmer, the creator of Felix the Cat, animation's first ""star"" character. After World War II, he bought a fleet of surplus airships and used them for advertising. Leigh was also a pioneer in the illumination of city skylines; he was the one who thought of lighting up Manhattan's skyscrapers, beginning with the Empire State Building, in 1976 and continuing with the lighting and gilding of the Con Edison Building, the Helmsley Building, and the Crown Building. This idea was adopted by many other cities, including Cincinnati, Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, New Orleans, and Baltimore with Leigh traveling there to supervise the final installation. Leigh's career continued into the 1990's.","Anniston, Ala.","New York, N.Y.",1907,1999,Douglas Leigh,"Leigh, Douglas, 1907-1999",Douglas,6499,Leigh

He was art critic for the New York American, the Hearst Paper. After graduating from Kansas Wesleyan University in 1908, Craven lived in Paris for a time. Upon his return to the United States, he settled in Greenwich Village where he began his reaffirmation of American art and culture. He roomed with American painter Thomas Hart Benton and was friends with John Steuart Curry, George Grosz, Reginald Marsh and Grant Wood. Craven's first book, Men of Art, was published in 1931. The book was an art historical survey of painting in the Western world and described as a combination of social history, biography and description and criticism. Craven also wrote Modern Art, A Treasury of Art Masterpieces, and Greek Art. Craven was noted for his often caustic reviews and criticisms of the modernistic movement.

"Jeweler; Sausalito, California, b.1918. June Schwarcz, a long-time resident of Sausalito, Calif., is one of the preeminent contemporary enamelists in the United States. She has an international reputation in a medium that corresponds with her forty years in California. Looking to nature for inspiration, she began enameling readymade copper vessels. Soon she began hammering her own bowls. Eventually she developed a signature method of drawing paper patterns and cutting them from a lightweight, flexible copper foil that was amenable to folding and sewing like textiles. The piece is then immersed in an electroforming bath for several days. The resulting enameled or oxidized vessels represent a unique development in enamel-on-metal technique, one that distinguishes her among her fellow American crafts artists.","Denver, Colo.",,1918,,June Therese Schwarcz,"Schwarcz, June Therese, 1918-",June Therese,6540,Schwarcz

"Michael Frimkess (1937- ) is a ceramist from Venice, California. Magdalena Frimkess is a ceramist from Venice, California. Paul J. Karlstrom is the director of the West Coast Resource Center, Archives of American Art, San Marino, California. Michael Frimkess was a leading innovator of the California fine art clay movement that grew up around Peter Voulkos and his ""pot shop"" at the Otis Art Institute. An element that distinguished the vessels that made Michael Frimkess's reputation was the surface decoration based on popular culture and a Pop Art sensibility. This signature style, consisting of small figures mimicking classical or pre-Columbian friezes, was further developed by Frimkess's wife Magdalena (Suarez Frimkess) who eventually, as Michael's multiple sclerosis progressed, did most of the painting of the vessels.<br />
 Magdalena was born in Venezuela and was sent to an orphanage at age 7, when her mother died and her father was unable to support her. Later she moved to Chile where her two children were born. When she was offered a fellowship to the Clay Art Center in New York her companion told her she would have to choose between that and him and the children. She reluctantly chose art, but kept up with her offspring who eventually moved to California. Her sculpture career was to a large extent subsumed after she met and married Michael Frimkess.","Los Angeles, Calif.",,1937,,Michael Frimkess,"Frimkess, Michael, 1937-",Michael,6545,Frimkess

In 1920, Criss was awarded the prestigious Cresson scholarship by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts which allowed him to further his studies in Europe. Criss' first public success as an artist was his inclusion in the inaugural 1932 Whitney Biennial Exhibition; the museum purchased his painting, Astor Place (1932) for its permanent collection. In 1934, Criss was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study in Italy. Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, Criss was involved with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the American Artists' Congress, which he helped to organize in 1936.

He first exhibited professionally in the spring of 1959 when one of his Black paintings, Club Onyx, was included in a group show. Opportunities to show in group and solo exhibitions continued at a steady pace, and in 1961 Stella had his first one-man show in Europe.

Another noteworthy achievement includes his appointment as the Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard for the academic year 1983-84.

"Painter, printmaker. Artist Hans Burkhardt (1904-1994) was a painter, and printmaker. Artist Hans Burkhardt (1904-1994) was born in Basel, Switzerland, and moved in 1924 to New York to join his father who had established himself there as cabinetmaker/foreman at Schmieg & Co. Burkhardt worked there from 1925 for about ten years, moving to Los Angeles in 1937 where he found work as a furniture finisher. While in New York Burkhardt studied painting on the side with Arshile Gorky, with whom he collaborated on two compositions, The Circus (1936) and Abstraction (1936-37). When Gorky suffered financial difficulties, Burkhardt brought food to the studio and and provided support by purchasing about thirty paintings. He also met Willem de Kooning at Gorky<U+2019>s studio. In Los Angeles, where he remained until his death, Burkhardt met artists such as Lorser Feitelson, Man Ray, Eugene Berman, and Knud Merrild, whose abstractions reinforced Burkhardt<U+2019>s natural tendency in that direction. He has been described as the West Coast<U+2019>s first true abstract expressionist, but over the years figurative elements<U+2014>notably nudes<U+2014>played an important part in his numerous pastels and prints. Burkhardt worked as a prop painter at MGM and taught at UCLA, Chouinard Art Institute, and later at California State University (formerly College), Northridge. Upon his death, a large gift of paintings was made to the CSUN art gallery. In 1947 he met Thordis Haaversen Westhassel (1913-1993) whom he married in 1955. They lived together in the house and studio he built off Laurel Canyon Blvd. in the Hollywood Hills. Among his artist neighbors was Ed Kienholz.

Combining the aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement and Asian Art, he practiced and taught a philosophy that coalesced beauty and utility. As Kevin Starr, California State Librarian, described his views on design, ""Anything useful should be beautiful; and beauty, far from being a mere embellishment, should be considered the most useful attribute of all.""
